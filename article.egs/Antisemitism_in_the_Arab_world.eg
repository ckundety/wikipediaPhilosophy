While [[Arab]]s are also a [[Semitic]] people, the modern meaning of the English term &quot;antisemitism&quot; refers primarily to discrimination against Jews (see [[Antisemitism#Etymology and usage|Antisemitism: Etymology and usage]]).Arab antisemitism is believed to have expanded since the 19th century. Jews, like other minority groups within the [[Muslim world]], were subject to various restrictions long before that (see [[Dhimmi]]). However, despite its restrictive nature, dhimmi status also afforded the &quot;[[People of the Book]]&quot; relative security against persecution and welfare most of the time—a protection that was missing for non-Christians in most of Europe until the institutionalization of equality under a secular idea of citizenship after the [[French Revolution]]—and allowed them to enjoy their respective religious laws and ways of life.Antisemitism in the Arab world has increased greatly in modern times, for many reasons: the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire and traditional Islamic society; European influence, brought about by Western [[imperialism]] and [[Christian Arabs]];&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi propaganda]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Yadlin&quot;&gt;Yadlin, Rifka. &quot;Antisemitism.&quot; ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''. Ed. [[Avraham Sela]]. New York: Continuum, 2002. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of Arab nationalism. In addition, there was resentment of disproportionate influence Jews had gained under [[colonialism]], and of the [[Zionist movement]]. The rise of [[political Islam]] during the 1980s and afterwards provided a new mutation of [[Islamic anti-semitism|Islamic anti-Semitism]], which gave the hatred of Jews a religious component.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yadlin&quot; /&gt;For most of the past fourteen hundred years, according to [[Bernard Lewis]], Arabs have not been antisemitic as the word is used in the West. In his view this is because, for the most part, Arabs are not [[Christians]] brought up on stories of [[Jewish deicide]]. In Islam, such stories are rejected by the [[Qur'an]] as a blasphemous absurdity. Since Muslims do not consider themselves as the &quot;true Israel&quot;, they do not feel threatened by the survival of Jews. Because Islam did not retain the [[Old Testament]], no clash of interpretations between the two faiths can therefore arise. There is, says Lewis, no Muslim theological dispute between their religious institutions and the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), pg. 117-8&lt;/ref&gt;While there were antisemitic incidents in the early twentieth century, antisemitism has certainly been heightened by the Arab-Israeli conflict. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Palestinian exodus, the creation of the state of Israel, [[Israel]]i victories during the wars of [[Suez Crisis#Invasion|1956]] and [[Six day war|1967]] served a severe shock to the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), pg. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The situation of the Middle Eastern Jews worsened and almost all [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands|fled or were expelled from their native countries]]. By the 1980s, according to Bernard Lewis, the volume of antisemitic literature published in the Arab world, and the authority of its sponsors, seemed to suggest that classical antisemitism had become an essential part of Arab intellectual life, considerably more than in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century France, and to a degree that has been compared to [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernard Lewis 1986, p. 256&quot;&gt;Lewis, Bernard. ''Semites and Antisemites'', New York/London: Norton, 1986, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;In their 2008 report on contemporary Arab-Muslim antisemitism, the Israeli [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center]] dates the beginning of this phenomenon to the spread of classic European Christian antisemitism into the Arab world starting in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;itic&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/pdf/a_s_170408e.pdf Contemporary Arab-Muslim anti-Semitism, its Significance and Implications]&quot;, [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Israel Intelligence Heritage &amp; Commemoration Center (IICC)]], April 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;==Medieval times==Jews, along with [[Christianity|Christian]]s and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], typically had the legal status of [[dhimmi]] (protected minority) in the [[Muslim history|lands conquered by Muslim Arabs]], generally applied to non-Muslim minorities. Jews were generally seen as a religious group (not a separate race), thus being a part of the &quot;Arab family&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1999), pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt;Dhimmi were subjected to a number of restrictions, the application and severity of which varied with time and place. Restrictions included residency in [[Racial segregation|segregated]] quarters, obligation to wear distinctive clothing, public subservience to Muslims, prohibitions against proselytizing and against marrying Muslim women, and limited access to the legal system (the testimony of a Jew did not count if contradicted by that of a Muslim). Dhimmis had to pay a special poll tax (the &quot;[[jizya]]&quot;), which exempted them from military service, and also from payment of the [[Zakat]] alms tax required of Muslims. In return, dhimmis were granted limited rights including a degree of tolerance, community autonomy in personal matters, and protection from being killed outright. Jewish communities, like Christian ones, were typically constituted as semi-autonomous entities managed by their own laws and leadership, who carried the responsibility for the community towards the Muslim rulers.By medieval standards, conditions for Jews under Islam was generally more formalized and better than those of Jews in Christian lands, in part due to the sharing of minority status with Christians in these lands. There is evidence for this claim in that the status of Jews in lands with no Christian minority was usually worse than their status in lands with one. For example, there were numerous incidents of [[list of events named massacres|massacres]] and [[ethnic cleansing]] of Jews in North Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 The Forgotten Refugees]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Morocco]], [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]] where eventually Jews were forced to live in [[mellah|ghettos]].&lt;ref&gt;Roumani, Maurice.

Von Grunebaum:&lt;blockquote&gt;It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Von Grunebaum, ''Eastern Jewry Under Islam'', 1971, p.369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;==Views in Modernity==Some{{Who|date=May 2011}} scholars hold that Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the nineteenth century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalism, and was imported into the Arab world primarily by nationalistically minded Christian Arabs (and only subsequently was it &quot;Islamized&quot;), Mark Cohen states.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies, p.208&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bernard Lewis]]:{{quote|The volume of anti-Semitic books and articles published, the size and number of editions and impressions, the eminence and authority of those who write, publish and sponsor them, their place in school and college curricula, their role in the mass media, would all seem to suggest that classical anti-Semitism is an essential part of Arab intellectual life at the present time-almost as much as happened in Nazi Germany, and considerably more than in late nineteenth and early twentieth century France.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernard Lewis 1986, p. 256&quot; /&gt;}}===Nineteenth century===The [[Damascus affair]] was an accusation of [[ritual murder]] and a [[blood libel against Jews]] in [[Damascus]] in 1840. On February 5, 1840, [[Franciscan]] [[Capuchin friar]] Father Thomas and his Greek servant were reported missing, never to be seen again. The [[Turkey|Turkish]] governor and the French consul [[Ratti-Menton]] believed accusations of ritual murder and blood libel, as the alleged murder occurred before the Jewish [[Passover]]. An investigation was staged, and Solomon Negrin, a Jewish barber, [[Forced confession|confessed under torture]] and accused other Jews. Two other Jews died under torture, and one (Moses Abulafia) converted to [[Islam]] to escape torture. More arrests and atrocities followed, culminating in 63 Jewish children being held [[hostage]] and mob attacks on Jewish communities throughout the Middle East. International outrage led to [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in Egypt ordering an investigation. Negotiations in [[Alexandria]] eventually secured the unconditional release and recognition of innocence of the nine prisoners still remaining alive (out of thirteen). Later in [[Constantinople]], [[Moses Montefiore]] (leader of the British Jewish community) persuaded Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] to issue a [[firman (decree)|firman]] (edict) intended to halt the spread of blood libel accusations in the [[Ottoman Empire]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;... and for the love we bear to our subjects, we cannot permit the Jewish nation, whose innocence for the crime alleged against them is evident, to be worried and tormented as a consequence of accusations which have not the least foundation in truth...&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nevertheless, pogroms spread through the Middle East and North Africa: Aleppo (1850, 1875), Damascus (1840, 1848, 1890), Beirut (1862, 1874), Dayr al-Qamar (1847), Jaffa (1876), Jerusalem (1847, 1870 and 1895), Cairo (1844, 1890, 1901–02), Mansura (1877), Alexandria (1870, 1882, 1901–07), Port Said (1903, 1908), and Damanhur (1871, 1873, 1877, 1891).&lt;ref&gt;Yossef Bodansky. &quot;Islamic Anti-Semitism as a Political Instrument&quot; Co-Produced by The Ariel Center for Policy Research and The Freeman Center for Strategic Studies, 1999.

Passionate outbursts of antisemitism in France were echoed in areas of French influence, especially [[Maronite]] [[Lebanon]].

British troops stationed in Palestine arrived fresh from deployment in the [[Russian civil war]], fighting alongside the genocidal antisemitic [[White Movement]]. The British forces are credited with introducing the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] to Palestine.   In March 1921, Musa Khazem El Husseini, Mayor of Jerusalem, told [[Winston Churchill]] &quot;The Jews have been amongst the most active advocates of destruction in many lands... It is well known that the disintegration of Russia was wholly or in great part brought about by the Jews, and a large proportion of the defeat of Germany and Austria must also be put at their door.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Morris, Benny, ''Righteous Victims'', Knopf, 1999, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Matthias Küntzel]] has suggested that the decisive transfer of [[antisemitism|Jewish conspiracy theory]] took place between 1937 and 1945 under the impact of Nazi propaganda targeted at the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Küntzel, Matthias, &quot;National Socialism and Anti-Semitism in the Arab World&quot;, ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 17:1–2 (Spring 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kuntzel, the Nazi Arabic radio service had a staff of 80 and broadcast everyday in Arabic, stressing the similarities between Islam and Nazism and supported by the activities of the [[Mufti of Jerusalem]], [[Haj Amin al-Husayni]] (who broadcast pro-Nazi propaganda from Berlin).  The Nazi regime also provided funding to the Egyptian [[Moslem Brotherhood]], which began calling for boycotts of Jewish businesses in 1936.Bernard Lewis also describes Nazi influence in the Arab world, including its impact on [[Michel Aflaq]], founder of the [[Ba'ath]] movement (which later dominated Syria and Iraq).&lt;blockquote&gt; After the promulgation of the [[Nuremberg Laws]], Hitler received telegrams of congratulation from all over the Arab and Muslim world, especially from Morocco and Palestine, where the Nazi propaganda had been most active... ... Before long political parties of the Nazi and Fascist type began to appear, complete with paramilitary youth organizations, colored shirts, strict discipline and more or less charismatic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]].

ISBN 978-0-393-31839-5, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;While anti-Semitism was certainly heightened by the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], there were [[pogrom]]s against Jews prior to the foundation of [[Israel]], including [[Nazism|Nazi]]-inspired pogroms in [[Algeria]] in the 1930s, and attacks on the Jews in [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] in the 1940s (see [[Farhud]]). George Gruen attributes the increased animosity towards Jews in the [[Arab world]] to several factors, including: the breakdown of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and traditional [[Islamic]] society; domination by Western [[colonialism|colonial powers]] under which Jews gained a disproportionately large role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of [[Arab nationalism]], whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local Jews through government channels; resentment over Jewish [[nationalism]] and the Zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular [[regime]]s to [[scapegoat]] local Jews for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen, George E. [http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm &quot;The Other Refugees: Jews of the Arab World&quot;], ([[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]).&lt;/ref&gt;After the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], the [[Palestinian exodus]], the creation of the state of [[Israel]], and the independence of Arab countries from European control, conditions for Jews in the Arab world deteriorated.  Over the next few decades, almost all would flee the Arab world, some willingly, and some under threat (see [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]). In 1945 there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews (see table below) living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as [[Libya]] (which was once around 3% Jewish), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.===Modern examples=======Arab League====On December 2, 1945, the newly formed [[Arab League]] Council declared a formal boycott against Jewish products. &quot;Jewish products and manufactured goods shall be considered undesirable to the Arab countries.&quot; All Arab &quot;institutions, organizations, merchants, commission agents and individuals&quot; were called upon &quot;to refuse to deal in, distribute, or consume Zionist products or manufactured goods.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Bard, Mitchell.[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Arab_boycott.html &quot;The Arab Boycott&quot;] ([[JVL]])&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott began to wane only in the 1970s.====Israeli Arabs====During a speech in 2007, Israeli-Arab [[Raed Salah]], the leader of the northern branch of the [[Islamic Movement in Israel]], accused Jews of [[blood libel|using children's blood to bake bread]]. &quot;We have never allowed ourselves to knead [the dough for] the bread that breaks the fast in the holy month of Ramadan with children's blood,&quot; he said. &quot;Whoever wants a more thorough explanation, let him ask what used to happen to some children in Europe, whose blood was mixed in with the dough of the [Jewish] holy bread.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stern |first=Yoav |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/islamic-movement-head-charged-with-incitement-to-racism-violence-1.238209 |title=Islamic Movement head charged with incitement to racism, violence |publisher=Haaretz |author= |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Arab parliamentarian [[Ahmad Tibi]] declared, &quot;Whoever sells his house to Jews, has sold his soul to Satan and has done a despicable act.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic world report'', Volume 7, p. 13, [[Ignatius Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt;====Egypt====Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]] leader [[Mohammed Mahdi Akef]] has denounced what he called &quot;the myth of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]&quot; in defending Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s [[Holocaust denial|denial]] of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4554986.stm &quot;Egyptian Islamists deny Holocaust&quot;], ''BBC News Online'', December 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Egypt]]ian government-run newspaper, ''Al-Akhbar'', on April 29, 2002 published an editorial denying the Holocaust as a fraud.
