Peters, ''Islam'', p.4, Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;===Christianity===The [[Aramaic]] word for &quot;God&quot; in the language of the [[New Testament]] is ''{{Unicode|ʼĔlāhā}}'', or ''[[Alaha]]'' in later [[Syriac]], as used by [[Assyrian Christians]].[[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speakers of all Abrahamic faiths, including Christians and Jews, use the word &quot;Allah&quot; to mean &quot;God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;/&gt; The Christian Arabs of today have no other word for 'God' than 'Allah'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;/&gt; (Even the Arabic-descended [[Maltese language]] of [[Malta]], whose population is almost entirely [[Roman Catholic]], uses ''Alla'' for 'God'.) Arab Christians for example use terms ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh al-ʾab}}'' ({{lang|ar|الله الأب}}) meaning [[God the Father]], ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh al-ibn}}'' ({{lang|ar|الله الابن}}) mean [[Son of God|God the Son]], and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh ar-rūḥ al-quds}}'' ({{lang|ar|الله الروح القدس}}) meaning [[Holy Spirit|God the Holy Spirit]] (See [[God in Christianity]] for the Christian concept of God).[[Arab Christian]]s have used two forms of invocations that were [[affix]]ed to the beginning of their written works. They adopted the Muslim ''{{transl|ar|DIN|bismi-llah}}'', and also created their own Trinitized ''{{transl|ar|DIN|bismi-llah}}'' as early as the eight century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; The Muslim ''{{transl|ar|DIN|bismi-llah}}'' reads: &quot;In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.&quot; The Trinitized ''{{transl|ar|DIN|bismi-llah}}'' reads: &quot;In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God.&quot; The [[Syria]]c, [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] invocations do not have the words &quot;One God&quot; at the end. This addition was made to emphasize the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] aspect of Trinitian belief and also to make it more palatable to Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;Thomas E. Burman, ''Religious Polemic and the Intellectual History of the Mozarabs'', [[Brill Publishers|Brill]], 1994, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;According to [[Marshall Hodgson]], it seems that in the pre-Islamic times, some Arab Christians made pilgrimage to the Kaaba, a pagan temple at that time, honoring Allah there as God the Creator.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall G. S. Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization'', [[University of Chicago Press]], p.156&lt;/ref&gt;===Judaism==={{main|Mizrahi Jews|Names of God in Judaism}}As [[Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]] are closely related [[Semitic]] languages, it is commonly accepted that ''Allah'' (root, ''[[ʾilāh|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾilāh}}]]'') and the Biblical ''[[Elohim]]'' are cognate derivations of same origin, as in ''[[Eloah]]'' a Hebrew word which is used (e.g. in the [[Book of Job]]) to mean &quot;(the) God&quot; and also &quot;god or gods&quot; as in the case of ''Elohim'', ultimately deriving from the root ''El'', &quot;strong&quot;, possibly genericized from [[El (deity)]], as in the [[Ugaritic]] '''lhm'' &quot;children of El&quot; (the ancient Near Eastern creator god in pre-Abrahamic tradition).==As a loanword=====English and other European languages==={{Islam}}The history of the word &quot;Allāh&quot; in [[English language|English]] was probably influenced by the study of [[comparative religion]] in 19th century; for example, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was anything different from God. However, in his biography of Muhammad (1934), [[Tor Andræ]] always used the term Allah, though he allows that this 'conception of God' seems to imply that it is different from that of the Jewish and Christian theologies.By this time Christians were also becoming accustomed to retaining the Hebrew term &quot;[[YHWH]]&quot; untranslated{{Dubious|date=January 2011}} (it was previously translated as 'the Lord').&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt45&quot;&gt;William Montgomery Watt, ''Islam and Christianity today: A Contribution to Dialogue'', [[Routledge]], 1983, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;Languages which may not commonly use the term ''Allah'' to denote God may still contain popular expressions which use the word. For example, because of the centuries long [[Al-Andalus|Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula]], the word ojalá in the [[Spanish language]] and oxalá in the [[Portuguese language]] exist today, borrowed from [[Arabic]] (Arabic: إن شاء الله). This word literally means &quot;God willing&quot; (in the sense of &quot;I hope so&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Islam in Luce López Baralt, ''Spanish Literature: From the Middle Ages to the Present'', Brill, 1992, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;Some Muslims leave the name &quot;Allāh&quot; untranslated in English.&lt;ref&gt;F.

Consequently, the majority of [[Arabic Unicode]] fonts do not conform with the specification and have a glyph without the alif at this position (e.g. those provided by [http://www.linotype.com/2517/arabicfonts.html Linotype], the great majority of those licensed to or developed by [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/FontPortal.aspx?PID=8 Microsoft], those of [http://www.arabeyes.org Arabeyes.org], [[SIL International|SIL]]'s [http://scripts.sil.org/ArabicFonts Lateef] and the fonts of [http://www.crulp.org CRULP] developed in Pakistan),while others have the prescribed form with alif (e.g. [http://scripts.sil.org/ArabicFonts SIL's Scheherazade], [http://www.tdc.org/news/2006Results/AdobeArabic.html Adobe Arabic] distributed with the Middle-Eastern versionof the [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html Adobe Reader 7], [[Arial Unicode MS]], and [http://sakkal.com/type/typesetting.html Arabic Typesetting], distributed with [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT.mspx VOLT] and with [http://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/language/proofingtools.mspx Microsoft Office Proofing Tools 2003]).The calligraphic variant of the word used as the [[Coat of arms of Iran]] is encoded in Unicode, in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] range, at codepoint U+262B ({{unicode|☫}}).==See also=={{Wikisource}}* [[Abdullah (name)]]* [[Ilah|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾIlāh}}]]* [[Names of God]]* [[Tawhid|{{transl|ar|DIN|Tawḥīd}}]]* [[Dhikr|{{transl|ar|DIN|Ḏikr}}]]* [[Termagant]]* [[Five Pillars of Islam]]* [[Kaaba|{{transl|ar|DIN|Kaʿbah}}]]* [[Prophets of Islam]]==Notes=={{Reflist|2}}==References==* The Unicode Consortium, ''Unicode Standard 5.0'', Addison-Wesley, 2006, ISBN 978-0-321-48091-0, [http://unicode.org/book/aboutbook.html About the Unicode Standard Version 5.0 Book]==External links=={{wikiquote}}{{Commons+cat|Allah}}* [http://www.searchtruth.com/Allah/99Names.php Names of Allah with meaning on website, Flash, and Mobile phone Software.]* [http://www.sultan.org/articles/god.html Concept of God (Allah) in Islam]* [http://www.islam-info.ch/en/Who_is_Allah.htm The Concept of Allāh according to the Qur'an] by Abdul Mannan Omar* [http://www.muslim.org/islam/allah.htm Allah, the unique name of God]; Typography* [http://www.smi.uib.no/ksv/ArabicFonts.html Arabic fonts and Mac OS X]* [http://www.smi.uib.no/ksv/ArabicProgsx.html Programs for Arabic in Mac OS X]{{Islam topics|state=collapsed}}[[Category:Allah]][[Category:Arabic loanwords]][[Category:Islamic theology]][[Category:Islam]][[Category:Names of God]][[Category:God]][[Category:Creator deities]][[ace:Allah]][[af:Allah]][[am:አላህ]][[ar:الله (إسلام)]][[ast:Alá]][[av:Аллагь]][[az:Allah]][[bn:আল্লাহ]][[ba:Аллаһ]][[be:Алах]][[be-x-old:Паняцьце Бога ў ісламе]][[bs:Allah]][[br:Allah]][[bg:Аллах]][[ca:Al·là]][[cs:Alláh]][[cy:Al-lâh]][[da:Allah]][[de:Allah]][[dv:ﷲ]][[et:Allah]][[el:Αλλάχ]][[es:Alá]][[eo:Alaho]][[eu:Allah]][[fa:الله]][[fr:Allah]][[gl:Alá]][[ko:알라]][[hy:Ալլահ]][[hr:Alah]][[id:Allah]][[ia:Allah]][[is:Allah]][[it:Allah]][[he:אללה]][[jv:Allah]][[kn:ಅಲ್ಲಾಹ]][[ka:ალაჰი]][[kk:Аллах]][[sw:Allah]][[ku:Allah]][[lv:Allāhs]][[lb:Allah]][[lt:Alachas]][[hu:Allah]][[mk:Алах]][[ml:അല്ലാഹു]][[mt:Alla]][[ms:Allah]][[mrj:Аллах]][[nl:Allah]][[nds-nl:Allah]][[ja:アッラーフ]][[ce:Аллахl]][[no:Allah]][[nn:Allah]][[mhr:Аллах]][[uz:Alloh]][[pnb:الله]][[pl:Allah]][[pt:Alá]][[ro:Allah]][[ru:Аллах]][[sah:Аллах]][[sq:Allahu]][[scn:Allah]][[simple:Allah]][[sd:الله]][[ss:Allah]][[sk:Alah]][[sl:Alah]][[so:Allaah]][[ckb:خوا لە ئیسلامدا]][[sr:Алах]][[sh:Allah]][[su:Alloh]][[fi:Allah]][[sv:Allah]][[ta:அல்லா]][[tt:Allah]][[th:อัลลอฮ์]][[tg:Оллоҳ]][[tr:Allah]][[uk:Аллах]][[ur:اللہ]][[vi:Allah]][[yo:Allah]][[zh:安拉]]</text></revision></page>
