The word doesn't occur in the Vedas, but is recorded in {{IAST|[[Pāṇini]]}} (3.3.120).''{{IAST|Avatāra}}'' was initially used to describe different deities, then around the 6th century CE it began to be used primarily to describe the manifestations of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheth, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;While earlier texts mention deities taking on different forms, the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' (4.5-9) is the first text to discuss the doctrine associated with the term even though the word ''avatāra'' itself is not mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Sheth, pp. 98, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;The common translation &quot;incarnation&quot; due to its [[incarnation (Christianity)|christological implications]] is somewhat misleading as the concept of avatar corresponds more closely to the view of [[Docetism]] in Christian theology, as different from the idea of God 'in the flesh' in mainstream [[Christology]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Geoffrey Parrinder, ''Avatar and incarnation'' (1970, 1997), chapter &quot;Docetism, in Buddhism and Christology&quot;, pp. 240ff.; Mercy Amba Oduyoye, H. M. Vroom, ''One gospel – many cultures: case studies and reflections on cross-cultural theology'', Rodopi, 2003, ISBN 9789042008977, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheth, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;Related to the idea of avatar is that of ''{{IAST|[[vibhūti]]}}'', that is, the idea of manifestations of the divine in various aspects of human life and the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Sheth, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;==Avatars of Vishnu=={{Main|Vishnu}}[[File:Matsya painting.jpg|thumb|left|[[Matsya]], fish avatar of Vishnu]]The concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with [[Vishnu]], the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or [[Trimurti]] or the one and only supreme God for followers of [[Vaishnavism]].Vishnu's avatars typically descend for a very specific purpose. An oft-quoted passage from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu—to bring ''[[dharma]]'', or righteousness, back to the social and cosmic order:&lt;ref name=&quot;Matchett&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale's&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;{{cquote|Whenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousness increases I send myself forth.&lt;br&gt;For the protection of the good and for the destruction of evil,&lt;br&gt;and for the establishment of righteousness,&lt;br&gt;I come into being age after age.}} (Gita:4.7–8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The descents of Vishnu are also integral to His teaching and tradition, whereas the accounts of other deities are not so strictly dependent on their avatar stories. Although it is usual to speak of Vishnu as the source of the avatars, within the [[Vaishnavism]] branch of Hinduism [[Narayana]], [[Vasudeva]], and [[Krishna]] are also seen as names denoting divine aspects which descend as avatars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matchett&quot; /&gt;The [[Bhagavata Purana]] describes Vishnu's avatars as innumerable, though there are ten incarnations (''[[Dasavatara]]'', [[Sanskrit]]: ten avatars) that are widely seen as his major appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matchett&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryant&quot; /&gt; Krishna and [[Rama]] are the two mostly widely known and worshiped avatars of Vishnu, with their stories told in the two popular epics, the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Anna S.|title=The intimate other: love divine in Indic religions|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=2005|pages=32–33|isbn=9788125028017|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0FvH1aCXETwC&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different lists of Vishnu's avatars appear in different texts, including: the ''dasavatara'' from the [[Garuda Purana]]; lists of twenty-two, twenty-three, and sixteen avatars in the [[Bhagavata Purana]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Mishra&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=Vibhuti Bhushan|title=Religious beliefs and practices of North India during the early mediaeval period, Volume 1|publisher=BRILL|year=1973|pages=4–5|isbn=9789004036109|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nAQ4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt; thirty-nine avatars in the ''{{IAST|[[Pañcaratra|Ahirbudhnya saṃhitā]]}}'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrader|first=Friedrich Otto |title=Introduction to the Pāñcarātra and the Ahirbudhnya saṃhitā|publisher=Adyar Library|year=1916|page=42|url=http://books.google.com/?id=OlgLAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''dasavatara'' again in [[Agni Purana]]; the first eight of the ''dasavatara'' in [[Padma Purana]].

For example: ''Purusavatara'' is the first avatara; ''Gunavataras'' are represented by the [[Trimurti]] ([[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]) who each preside over one of the [[gunas]] (rajas, sattva, and tamas); ''Lilavataras'' are the well-known ones, and include ''Avesavataras'' (beings into whom part of God Himself has entered) and ''saktyamsavesa'' (into whom only parts of His power enter); ''Kalpa-'', ''Manvantara-'', and ''Yuga-avataras'' descend during different cosmic ages.&lt;ref&gt;Sheth, pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;Some [[Vaishnavism]] schools consider Krishna to be the source of all avatars ([[Krishnaism]]).===Dashavatara==={{Main|Dashavatara}}[[File:Varaha avtar, killing a demon to protect Bhu, c1740.jpg|right|thumb|[[Varaha]], the boar avatar of Vishnu (18th century painting, probably of [[Pahari people|Pahari]] provenance)]]The ten best known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the ''Dasavatara'' (a [[dvigu]]compound meaning &quot;ten avatars&quot;).

But when he does not incarnate directly, but indirectly empowers some living entity to represent him, that living entity is called an indirect or ''avesa'' avatar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lordcaitanya.com/8/en1 Teachings of Lord Chaitanya – Avatars]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=January 2010}}There are said to be a great number of ''avesa'' avatars. Examples include [[Narada|Narada Muni]], [[Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu|Sugata Buddha]], and [[Parashurama]]. Parashurama is the only one of the traditional ten avatars that is not a direct descent of Vishnu.According to the [[Sri Vaishnavism]] sect of Hinduism, there are two types of primary or direct avatars, Purna avatars and Amsarupavatars:# Purna avatars are those in which Vishnu takes form directly and all the qualities and powers of God are expressed, (e.g. [[Narasimha]], [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]).,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srivaishnavan.com/ans_iswara.html#67 Types of Avatars; answers to questions #67-70.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlshq.org/religions/avatara.htm#kinds DLSHQ.org]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=January 2010}}# Amsarupavatars are those in which Vishnu takes form directly but He is manifest in the person only partially. (e.g. avatars from [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]] etc).The ''avesa'' or indirect avatars are generally not worshiped as the Supreme being. Only the direct, primary avatars are worshiped in this way. In practice, the direct avatars that are worshiped today are the Purna avatars of Narasimha, Rama and Krishna. Among most [[Vaishnava]] traditions, [[Krishna]] is considered to be the highest Purna avatar. However, followers of [[Chaitanya]] (including [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]]), [[Nimbarka]], and [[Vallabha Acharya]] differ philosophically from other [[Vaishnavas]], such as [[Ramanujacharya]] and [[Madhvacharya]], and consider [[Krishna]] to be the ultimate Godhead, not simply an avatar. That said, all Hindus believe that there is no difference between worship of [[Vishnu]] and His avatars as it all leads to Him. According to [[Madhvacharya]] (chief proponent of [[Dvaita]] or school of differential [[monism]]), all avatars of [[Vishnu]] are alike in potency and every other quality. There is no gradation among them, and perceiving or claiming any differences among avatars is a cause of eternal damnation.
