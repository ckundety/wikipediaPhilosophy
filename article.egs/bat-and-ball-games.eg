The teams alternate between &quot;batting&quot; and &quot;fielding&quot; roles, sometimes called &quot;in at bat&quot; and &quot;out in the field&quot;, or simply in and out. Only the batting team may score, so the fielding team is defending, but they have equal chances in both roles. The game is counted rather than timed.A player on the fielding team puts the ball in play with a delivery whose restriction depends on the game. A player on the batting team attempts to strike the delivered ball, commonly with a &quot;bat&quot;, which is a club governed by the rules of the game.After striking the ball, the batter may become a runner trying to reach a &quot;base&quot; or safe haven. While in contact with a base, the runner is safe from the fielding team and in a position to score runs. Leaving a safe haven places the runner in danger of being put out. The teams switch roles when the fielding team puts the batting ''team'' out, which varies by game.In modern baseball the fielders put three ''players'' out; in cricket they retire all players but one.Some games permit multiple runners and some have multiple bases to run in sequence. Batting may occur, and running begin, at one of the bases. The movement between those &quot;safe havens&quot; is governed by the rules of the particular game.Globally, [[cricket]] and [[baseball]] are the two most popular games in the family.==List of bat-and-ball games==* [[Baseball]]* [[Bat-and-Trap]]* [[British baseball]] - four posts* [[Brännboll]] - four bases* [[Corkball]] - four bases (no base-running)* [[Cricket]] - two wickets** [[Test cricket]]** [[First-class cricket]]** [[Blind cricket]]** [[Catchy Shubby Cricket|Catchy Shubby]]** [[Club cricket]]** [[French cricket]]** [[Gilli-danda]]** [[Kilikiti]]** [[One Day International]]** [[Kwik cricket]]** [[List A cricket]]** [[Pro40]]** [[Indoor Cricket]]** [[Limited overs cricket]]** [[Short form cricket]]** [[Single Wicket]]** [[Twenty20]]* [[Crocker (sport)]];* [[Danish longball]]* [[Lapta (game)|Lapta]] - two salos (bases)* [[The Massachusetts Game]] - four bases* [[Oina]]* [[Old Cat]] (One old cat, Two old cat, etc.) - variable* [[Over-the-line]] - qv* [[Pesäpallo]] - four bases* [[Rounders]] - four bases or posts run anti clock wise* [[Scrub baseball]] - four bases (not a team game ''per se'')* [[Softball]] - four bases* [[Stickball]] - variable* [[Stool ball]] - two stools* [[Tee Ball|T-Ball]]* [[Town ball]] - variable* [[Vigoro]] - two wickets* [[Wiffle Ball]]* [[Wireball]]Striking the ball with a &quot;bat&quot; or any type of stick is not crucial.
