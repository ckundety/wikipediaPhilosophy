Its headquarters are located in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, and its current [[List of FIFA presidents|president]] is [[Sepp Blatter]], who is in his fourth successive term. FIFA is responsible for the organisation and governance of football's major international tournaments, most notably the [[FIFA World Cup]], held since 1930. Nineteen editions of the FIFA World Cup have been held so far.The next edition is to be held in Brazil in 2014.FIFA has 208 member associations, three more than the [[International Olympic Committee]] and five fewer than the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]]: not all members are sovereign states.==History=={{main|History of FIFA}}The need for a single body to oversee the game became apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. FIFA was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904; the French name and acronym remain, even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of [[Royal Belgian Football Association|Belgium]], [[Danish Football Association|Denmark]], [[French Football Federation|France]], [[Royal Dutch Football Association|the Netherlands]], Spain (represented by [[Real Madrid C.F.|Madrid Football Club]]; [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|the Spanish federation]] was not created until 1913), [[Swedish Football Association|Sweden]] and [[Swiss Football Association|Switzerland]]. Also, that same day, the [[German Football Association|German Association]] declared its intention of affiliating through a telegram.The first president of FIFA was [[Robert Guérin]]. Guérin was replaced in 1906 by [[Daniel Burley Woolfall]] from [[The Football Association|England]], by then a member association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the football competition for the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics in London]] was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.Membership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of [[South African Football Association|South Africa]] in 1908, [[Argentine Football Association|Argentina]] and [[Federación de Fútbol de Chile|Chile]] in 1912, and [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] in 1913.During World War I, with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, there were few international fixtures, and the organisation's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organisation was run by Dutchman [[Carl Anton Wilhelm Hirschmann|Carl Hirschmann]]. It was saved from extinction, but at the cost of the withdrawal of the [[Home Nations]] (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies. The Home Nations later resumed their membership.The FIFA collection is held by the [[National Football Museum]] in England.==Structure==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of national teams with no FIFA World Cup appearances]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;{{Main|List of FIFA Member Associations}}[[File:World Map FIFA2.svg|thumb|400px|Map of the World with the six confederations: membership details below.]]FIFA is an association established under the Laws of [[Switzerland]]. Its headquarters are in [[Zurich]].FIFA's supreme body is the FIFA Congress, an assembly made up of representatives from each affiliated member association. The Congress assembles in ordinary session once every year and, additionally, extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes.Congress elects the President of FIFA, its General Secretary and the other members of [[FIFA Executive Committee|FIFA's Executive Committee]]. The President and General Secretary are the main officeholders of FIFA, and are in charge of its daily administration, carried out by the General Secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members.FIFA's Executive Committee, chaired by the President, is the main decision-making body of the organisation in the intervals of Congress. FIFA's worldwide organisational structure also consists of several other bodies, under authority of the Executive Committee or created by Congress as standing committees. Among those bodies are the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, the Referees Committee, etc.Beside from its worldwide institutions (presidency, Executive Committee, Congress, etc.) there are six confederations recognised by FIFA which oversee the game in the different continents and regions of the world. National associations, and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA. The continental confederations are provided for in FIFA's statutes, and membership of a confederation is a prerequisite to FIFA membership.:{{Colorbox|#ffb6c1}} [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC – Asian Football Confederation]]:::Australia have been members of the AFC since 2006:{{Colorbox|#deb887}} [[Confederation of African Football|CAF – Confédération Africaine de Football]]:{{Colorbox|#db7093}} [[CONCACAF|CONCACAF – Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football]]:::[[Guyana national football team|Guyana]], [[Suriname national football team|Suriname]], and [[French Guiana national football team|French Guiana]] are CONCACAF members although they are in South America:{{Colorbox|#8fbc8f}} [[CONMEBOL|CONMEBOL – Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol]]:{{Colorbox|#ffd700}} [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC – Oceania Football Confederation]] in Oceania:{{Colorbox|#4682b4}} [[UEFA|UEFA – Union of European Football Associations]]:::Teams representing [[Israel Football Association|Israel]] and the [[List of countries spanning more than one continent|transcontinental nations]] of [[Football Union of Russia|Russia]], [[Turkish Football Federation|Turkey]], [[Cyprus Football Association|Cyprus]], [[Football Federation of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgian Football Federation|Georgia]] are under the auspices of UEFA, as is, since 2002, [[Football Union of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]].In total, FIFA recognises 208 national associations and their associated men's national teams as well as 129 women's national teams; see the [[list of men's national football (soccer) teams|list of national football teams]] and their respective [[list of FIFA country codes|country codes]]. FIFA has more member states than the UN, as FIFA recognises 23 non-sovereign entities as distinct nations, such as the four [[Home Nations]] within the United Kingdom or politically disputed territories such as Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bruisedearth.org/?p=137 |title=Palestine Football: Escape to Victory? |publisher=Bruisedearth.org |date=27 October 2008 |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 9 sovereign entities don't belong to FIFA (Monaco, Vatican City, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Palau, Nauru and South Sudan).The [[FIFA World Rankings]] are updated monthly and rank each team based on their performance in international competitions, qualifiers, and friendly matches. There is also a [[FIFA Women's World Rankings|world ranking for women's football]], updated four times a year.The [[FIFA Congress]] is the supreme legislative body of FIFA, and has met 66 times since 1904. Since 1998 the congress has been held annually. At the congress decisions are made relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implication and application. The congress approves the annual report, and decides on the acceptance of new national associations and holds elections. Each national football association has one vote, regardless of its size or footballing strength. In the year following the [[FIFA World Cup]], the [[List of Presidents of FIFA|President of FIFA]] is elected.&lt;refname=&quot;fifa-congress&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |date=27 May 2011|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/congress.html|title=FIFA Congress|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Recognitions and awards==FIFA awards, each year, the title of [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] to the top men's and women's players of the year, as part of its annual awards ceremony which also recognises team and international football achievements.In 1994 FIFA published the [[FIFA World Cup All-Time Team]].In 2002 FIFA announced the [[FIFA Dream Team]], an all-time all-star team chosen by fans in a poll.As part of its centennial celebrations in 2004, FIFA organised a &quot;Match of the Century&quot; between [[France national football team|France]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]==Governance and game development=={{Main|Laws of the Game (association football)}}The laws that govern football, known officially as the ''Laws of the Game'', are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body called the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB). FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: [[The Football Association|England]], [[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]], [[Football Association of Wales|Wales]], and [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]], who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognised for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed by at least six of the eight delegates.===Discipline of national associations===FIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organisations or if the associate is not functioning properly.A 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs, and appear in official matches for a maximum of two, in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of [[FIFA Two|two former Ireland internationals]]. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.==FIFA Anthem=={{main|FIFA Anthem}}Since the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], like the [[UEFA Champions League]], FIFA has adopted an anthem composed by the German composer [[Franz Lambert]]. It has been recently re-arranged and produced by [[Rob May]] and [[Simon Hill]]. The FIFA Anthem is played at the beginning of official FIFA sanctioned matches and tournaments such as international friendlies, the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[FIFA Women's World Cup]], [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]], [[FIFA U-17 World Cup]], [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], [[FIFA Women's U-17 World Cup]], [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]], [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]], and [[FIFA Club World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9I7bn1b4oc |title=FIFA anthem |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;Since 2007, FIFA has also required most of its broadcast partners to use short sequences including the anthem at the beginning and end of FIFA event coverage, as well as for [[break bumper]]s, to help promote FIFA's sponsors. This emulates practices long used by some other international football events such as the UEFA Champions League. Exceptions may be made for specific events; for example, an original piece of African music was used for bumpers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.==Allegations of corruption and legislative interference=={{recentism|section|date=June 2011}}In May 2006 British investigative reporter [[Andrew Jennings]]' book ''Foul! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals'' ([[Harper Collins]]) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner ISL, and revealed how some football officials have been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for Sepp Blatter's continued control of FIFA.Shortly after the release of ''Foul!'' a [[BBC]] television exposé by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke for the BBC news programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' was broadcast. In this hour-long programme, screened on 11 June 2006, Jennings and the ''Panorama'' team agree that [[Sepp Blatter]] was being investigated by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than £1m worth of [[bribery|bribes]] pocketed by football officials.All testimonies offered in the Panorama expose were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one; Mel Brennan, formerly a lecturer at [[Towson University]] in the United States (and from 2001–2003 Head of Special Projects for [[CONCACAF]], a liaison to the e-FIFA project and a 2002 FIFA World Cup delegate), became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of greed, corruption, nonfeasance and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. During the Panorama exposé, Brennan—the highest-level African-American in the history of world football governance—joined Jennings, Trinidadian journalist [[Lisana Liburd]] and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money at CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviours at FIFA. Since then, and in the light of fresh allegations of bribery and corruption and opaque action by FIFA in late 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/fifa-corruption-pair-suspended-2137472.html |title=Fifa suspend six officials |date=18 November 2010|work=The Independent|accessdate=18 November 2010 | location=London |first1=Martyn |last1=Ziegler}}&lt;/ref&gt; both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical of FIFA, with Brennan calling directly for an alternative to FIFA to be considered by the stakeholders of the sport throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00bws9k/World_Football_20_11_2010/ |title=BBC iPlayer - World Football: 20/11/2010 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-11-20 |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;In a further Panorama documentary broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, [[Nicolas Leoz]], [[Issa Hayatou]] and [[Ricardo Teixeira]], had been paid huge bribes by FIFA's marketing partner [[International Sports Leisure]] (ISL) between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. He claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totalling about $100&amp;nbsp;million. A former ISL executive said that there were suspicions within ISL that the company was only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The programme also alleged that another current official, [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Sepp Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels'.The programme also criticized FIFA for allegedly requiring World Cup host bidding nations to agree to implement special laws for the World Cup, including blanket tax exemption for FIFA and sponsors, and limitation of workers' rights. It alleged that governments of bidding nations are required to keep the details of the required laws confidential during the bidding process; but that they were revealed by the [[Dutch government]], which refused to agree to them, as a result of which it was told by FIFA that its bid could be adversely affected. According to the programme, following Jennings' earlier investigations he was banned from all FIFA press conferences, for reasons he says have not been made clear; and the accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations, either verbally or by letter.British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and [[Andy Anson]], head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast, three days before FIFA's decision on the host for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], on the grounds that it might damage the UK's bid; the voters included officials accused by the programme.&lt;ref&gt;''Panorama'', [[BBC One]], 29 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11841783 &quot;Panorama: Three Fifa World Cup officials took bribe&quot;], [[BBC News]], 29 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;In June 2011 it came to light that  the [[IOC]] had started inquiry proceedings against Fifa honourary president [[Joao Havelange]] into claims of bribery. The BBC Panorama programme alleged that the Brazilian accepted a $1 million 'bung' in 1997 from International Sports Leisure (ISL). The Olympic governing body said &quot;the IOC takes all allegations of corruption very seriously and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/8581704/Fifa-honourary-president-Joao-Havelange-faces-IOC-inquiry.html |title=Fifa honourary president Joao Havelange faces IOC inquiry |publisher=Telegraph |date=2011-06-17 |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===2018 and 2022 World Cup bids==={{further|[[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids]]}}FIFA's choice to award the 2018 World Cup to [[Russia]] and the 2022 World Cup to [[Qatar]],  has been widely criticised by media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Barnes |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/fifa-is-a-gathering-of-nasty-mad-old-men/story-fn76vhk4-1225966425228 |title=FIFA is a gathering of nasty, mad old men |work=The Australian |date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Martin |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/news?slug=ro-worldcupvote120210 |title=Qatar selection adds to FIFA's ongoing folly – World Soccer – Yahoo!

In early May 2011, a British parliamentary inquiry into why England failed to secure the 2018 finals was told by member of parliament, Damian Collins, that there was evidence from the Sunday Times newspaper that [[Issa Hayatou]] of [[Cameroon]] and [[Jacques Anouma]] of [[Ivory Coast]] were paid by Qatar.  Qatar have categorically denied the allegations, as have Hayatou and Anouma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrikansoccer.com/2011/05/qatar-denies-paying-world-cup-bribes-to-hayatou-anouma/ |title=Qatar denies paying World Cup bribes to Hayatou, Anouma |publisher=Afrikansoccer.com |date=2011-05-11 |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;FIFA President Blatter said, as of May 23, 2011, that British newspaper The Sunday Times has agreed to bring its whistle-blowing source to meet senior FIFA officials, who will decide whether to order a new investigation into alleged World Cup bidding corruption.  &quot;[The Sunday Times] are happy, they agreed that they will bring this whistleblower here to Zurich and then we will have a discussion, an investigation of this,&quot; Blatter said.Specifically, the whistleblower claims that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were paid $1.5 million to vote for Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/ffa-coy-on-world-cup-bid-rerun-20110520-1ewr2.html |title=FFA coy on World Cup bid re-run |publisher=News.smh.com.au |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/923253/fifa-investigates-bin-hammam-bribery-claims?cc=5739 |title=FIFA investigates Bin Hammam bribery claims - ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emirate's bid beat the United States in a final round of voting last December.  Blatter did not rule out reopening the 2022 vote if corruption could be proved, but urged taking the matter &quot;step by step.&quot;  The FIFA president said his organization is &quot;anxiously awaiting&quot; more evidence before asking its ethics committee to examine allegations made in Britain's parliament in early May, 2011.  Qatar's success has been called into question since The Sunday Times submitted claims to a British lawmakers' inquiry into soccer governance, which included England's failed bid to win 2018 hosting rights.  Lawmakers released claims by a former bid employee that Qatar agreed to pay members of FIFA's 24-man executive committee for their votes.Hayatou, who is from Cameroon, leads the [[Confederation of African Football]] and is a FIFA vice president. Anouma is president of [[Ivorian Football Federation]].  The whistleblower said Qatar agreed to pay a third African voter, [[Amos Adamu]], for his support. The [[Nigerian]] was later suspended from voting after a FIFA ethics court ruled he solicited bribes from undercover Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists. Blatter said the newspaper and its whistleblower would meet with FIFA secretary general, [[Jerome Valcke]], and legal director, [[Marco Villiger]].Allegations against FIFA officials have also been made to the U.K. Parliament by [[David Triesman]], the former head of England's bid and the English Football Association.
