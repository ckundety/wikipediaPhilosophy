[http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA03411]]]'''Fiji''' is a group of [[volcano|volcanic]] [[island]]s in the South [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], lying about 4,450&amp;nbsp;km (2,775&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] and 1,770&amp;nbsp;km (1,100&amp;nbsp;mi) north of [[New Zealand]]. Of the 322 islands and 522 smaller islets making up the [[archipelago]], about 106 are permanently inhabited.  [[Viti Levu]], the largest island, covers about 57 % of the nation's land area, hosts the two official [[Local government of Fiji|cities]] (the [[Capital (political)|capital]] [[Suva]], and [[Lautoka]]) and most other major towns, such as [[Ba Town|Ba]], [[Nasinu]], and [[Nadi]] (the site of the international airport), and contains some 69 % of the population.  [[Vanua Levu]], 64&amp;nbsp;km to the north of Viti Levu, covers just over 30 % of the land area though is home to only some 15 % of the population.  Its main towns are [[Labasa]] and [[Savusavu]]. In the northeast it features [[Natewa Bay]], carving out the [[Loa]] peninsula.Both islands are mountainous, with peaks up to 1300 m rising abruptly from the shore, and covered with [[tropical forest]]s. Heavy rains (up to 304&amp;nbsp;cm or 120 inches annually) fall on the windward (southeastern) side, covering these sections of the islands with dense tropical forest. [[Lowland]]s on the western portions of each of the main islands are sheltered by the mountains and have a well-marked [[dry season]] favorable to crops such as [[sugarcane]].Other islands and island groups, which cover just 12.5 % of the land area and house some 16 % of the population, include [[Taveuni]] southeast off [[Vanua Levu]] and [[Kadavu Island]], south off [[Viti Levu]] (the third and fourth largest islands respectively), the [[Mamanuca Islands|Mamanuca Group]] (just off [[Nadi]]) and [[Yasawa Islands|Yasawa Group]] (to the north of the Mamanucas), which are popular [[tourist]] destinations, the [[Lomaiviti|Lomaiviti Group]] (just off Suva) with [[Levuka]], the former capital and the only major town on any of the smaller islands, located on the island of [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]], and the remote [[Lau Islands|Lau Group]] over the [[Koro Sea]] to the east near Tonga, from which it is separated by the [[Lakeba Passage]].Two outlying regions are [[Rotuma]], 400 km to the north, and the uninhabited coral atoll and [[cay]] [[Ceva-i-Ra]] or Conway Reef, 450 km to the southwest of main Fiji. Culturally conservative Rotuma with its 2000 people on 44 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[geography|geographically]] belongs to [[Polynesia]], and enjoys relative autonomy as a Fijian [[Dependent territory|dependency]].[[Fiji Television]] reported on 21 September 2006 that the [[Fiji Islands Maritime and Safety Administration]] (FIMSA), while reviewing its outdated maritime charts, had discovered the possibility that more islands could lie within Fiji's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]].More than half of Fiji's population lives on the island coasts, either in Suva or in smaller urban centers. The interior is sparsely populated because of its rough terrain.==Statistics==; Location:: Oceania, island group in the South Pacific Ocean; [[Geographic coordinates]]:: {{coord|18|00|S|179|00|E|type:country}}; Map references:: Oceania; Area::* Total: 18 274 km²:* Land: 18 274 km²&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sopac.org/Fiji&lt;/ref&gt;:* Water: 0 km²; Area - comparative:: Slightly smaller than [[New Jersey]]; slightly less than one third [[Nova Scotia]]'s size; slightly smaller than [[Wales]]; Land boundaries:: 0 km; Coastline:: 1 129 km; Maritime claims::* Measured from claimed archipelagic baselines:* Continental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation; rectilinear shelf claim added:* Exclusive economic zone: 200 [[Nautical mile|nm]]:* Territorial sea: Fiji comprises 12 nm; Climate:: Tropical marine; only slight seasonal temperature variation; Terrain::* Mostly mountains of volcanic origin, beautiful{{Peacock term|date=May 2011}} beaches; Elevation extremes::* Lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m:* Highest point: [[Mount Tomanivi]] 1 324 m; Natural resources:: [[Timber]], [[fish]], [[gold]], [[copper]], offshore [[petroleum|oil]] potential, hydropower; Land use::* Arable land: 10%:* Permanent crops: 4%:* Permanent pastures: 10%:* Forests and woodland: 65%:* Other: 11% (1993 est.); Irrigated land:: 30 km² (2003 est.); Natural hazards:: Cyclonic storms can occur from November to January; Environment - current issues:: Deforestation; soil erosion; Environment - international agreements::* Party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94:* Signed, but not ratified: None of the selected agreements; Geography - note:: Includes 844 islands and islets of which approximately 106 are inhabited== Extreme points ==This is a list of the extreme points of [[Fiji]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.* Northern-most point – [[Uae Island]], [[Rotuma]], [[Eastern Division, Fiji|Eastern Division]]* Eastern-most point – [[Vatoa Island]], [[Eastern Division, Fiji|Eastern Division]]* Southern-most point – [[Tuvana-i-Tholo]] island, [[Eastern Division, Fiji|Eastern Division]]* Western-most point -  [[Viwa Island]], [[Western Division, Fiji|Western Division]]==Antipodes==The [[antipodes]] of Fiji are in eastern [[Mali]], around the northernmost bend of the [[Niger River]].
