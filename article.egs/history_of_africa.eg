Agriculture began about 10,000 BCE and metallurgy in about 4000 BCE. The [[history]] of early civilization arose in [[Egypt]] and later in the [[Maghreb]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]] spread through the regions. Crossing the Maghreb and the [[Sahel]], a major centre of Muslim culture was at [[Timbuktu]]. States and polities subsequently formed throughout the continent.From the late 15th century, Europeans and Arabs took [[slave]]s from [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[East Africa|Southeast Africa]] overseas in the [[African slave trade]]. European colonization of Africa developed rapidly in the [[Scramble for Africa]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Following independence and struggles in many parts of the continent, [[decolonization]] took place after the [[Second World War]].Africa's history has been a challenge for researchers in the field of [[African studies]] because of the scarcity of written sources in large parts of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. Scholarly techniques such as the recording of [[oral history]], [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology of Africa|archaeology]] and [[genetic history of Africa|genetics]] have been crucial.{{TOCLimit|limit=3}}==Prehistory=={{See|Prehistoric Central North Africa|African archaeology}}===Paleolithic==={{Main|Lower Paleolithic|Middle Stone Age|Late Stone Age}}The first [[hominids]] evolved in Africa. According to [[paleontology]], the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to the gorilla and chimpanzee, [[great apes]] that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion and freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This occurred 10 to 5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, Kevin (2005), ''History of Africa'', p. 2. Rev. 2nd ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. ISBN 0-333-59957-8.&lt;/ref&gt;By 3 million years ago, several [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] hominid species had developed throughout [[Southern Africa|southern]], [[East Africa|eastern]] and [[central Africa]]. They were tool users, not makers of tools. They scavenged for meat and were omnivores.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;By approximately 2.3 million years ago, primitive stone tools were first used to scavenge kills made by other predators and to harvest carrion and marrow for their bones. In hunting, ''[[Homo habilis]]'' was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was still more prey than hunter. ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington 2005, p. 2-3&quot;&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;Around 1.8 million years ago ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved 1.5 million years ago.  Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like ''H. habilis''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Possibly the first hunters, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making [[fire]] and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of the [[Old World]] and perhaps later giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers suggest that ''[[Homo georgicus]]'' was the first and most primitive hominid to ever live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehret, Christopher (2002), ''The Civilizations of Africa'', p. 22.

Around 40,000 years ago, the species' expansion [[Single-origin hypothesis|out of Africa]] launched the colonization of the planet by modern human beings.

By 13,000 to 11,000 BCE, people began collecting wild grains. This spread to [[Western Asia]], which domesticated its wild grains, [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Between 10,000 and 8000 BCE, northeast Africa was cultivating wheat and barley and raising sheep and cattle from southwest Asia. A wet climatic phase in Africa turned the Ethiopian Highlands into a mountain forest. [[Omotic languages|Omotic speakers]] domesticated [[Ensete|enset]] around 6500-5500 BCE. Around 7000 BCE, the settlers of the Ethiopian highlands domesticated donkeys, and by 4000 BCE domesticated donkeys had spread to southwest Asia. [[Cushitic]] speakers, partially turning away from cattle herding, domesticated [[teff]] and [[finger millet]] between 5500 and 3500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared (1997), ''Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies'', pp. 126&amp;ndash;127.

Later, [[gourds]], [[watermelons]], [[castor beans]], and [[cotton]] were also collected and domesticated. The people started capturing wild cattle and holding them in circular thorn hedges, resulting in domestication.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (2002), pp. 64–75.&lt;/ref&gt; They also started making pottery. Fishing, using bone tipped harpoons, became a major activity in the numerous streams and lakes formed from the increased rains.In West Africa, the wet phase ushered in expanding rainforest and wooded savannah from [[Senegal]] to [[Cameroon]]. Between 9000 and 5000 BCE, [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo speakers]] domesticated the [[oil palm]] and [[raffia palm]]. Two seed plants, [[black-eyed peas]] and [[voandzeia]] (African groundnuts) were domesticated, followed by [[okra]] and [[kola nuts]]. Since most of the plants grew in the forest, the Niger–Congo speakers invented polished stone axes for clearing forest.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (2002), pp. 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt;Most of southern Africa was occupied by [[pygmy peoples]] and [[Khoisan]] who engaged in hunting and gathering. Some of the oldest rock art was produced by them.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (2002), pp. 94, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;Just prior to [[Sahara]]n desertification, the communities that developed south of [[Egypt]] in what is now modern day [[Sudan]] were full participants in the [[Neolithic revolution]] and lived a settled to semi-nomadic lifestyle, with domesticated plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/stsmith/research/nubia_history.html Dr. Stuart Tyson Smith]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that [[megalith]]s found at [[Nabta Playa]] are examples of the world's first known [[archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical]] devices, predating [[Stonehenge]] by some 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetquest.org/learn/nabta.html PlanetQuest Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The sociocultural complexity observed at Nabta Playa and expressed by different levels of authority within the society there has been suggested as forming the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the [[Old Kingdom]] of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html Late Neolithic megalithic structures at Nabta Playa] - Wendorf (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;By 5000 BCE, Africa entered a dry phase, and the climate of the Sahara region gradually became drier. The population trekked out of the Sahara region in all directions, including towards the [[Nile Valley]] below the [[Second Cataract]], where they made permanent or semipermanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in central and eastern Africa. Since then, dry conditions have prevailed in eastern Africa.===Metallurgy===The first metals to be smelted in Africa were [[lead]], [[copper]], and [[bronze]] in the fourth millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Paul T, and Ian Shaw (2000), ''Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology'', p. 168. Cambridge University Press.

Nubia was a major source of copper as well as [[gold]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wysinger.homestead.com/nubians.html Who are the Nubians?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of gold and [[silver]] in Egypt dates back to the predynastic period.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson and Shaw (2000), pp. 161–165, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehret 2002, pp. 136-137&quot;&gt;Ehret (2002), pp. 136&amp;ndash;137.&lt;/ref&gt;In the [[Aïr Mountains]], present-day [[Niger]], copper was smelted independently of developments in the Nile valley between 3000 and 2500 BCE. The process used was not well developed, indicating that it was not brought from outside the region; it became more mature by about 1500 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehret 2002, pp. 136-137&quot;/&gt;By the 1st millennium BCE, [[iron working]] had been introduced in northwestern Africa, Egypt, and Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm#Irontechnology Martin and O'Meara. &quot;Africa, 3rd Ed.&quot;] Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 670 BCE, Nubians were pushed out of Egypt by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] using iron weapons, after which the use of iron in the Nile valley became widespread.The theory of [[iron]] spreading to sub-Saharan Africa via the Nubian city of [[Meroe]] is no longer widely accepted. [[Metalworking]] in [[West Africa]] has been dated as early as 2500 BCE at Egaro west of the [[Termit Massif|Termit]] in Niger, and iron working was practiced there by 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3432&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Iron in Africa: Revising the History, UNESCO] Aux origines de la métallurgie du fer en Afrique, Une ancienneté méconnue: Afrique de l'Ouest et Afrique centrale.&lt;/ref&gt;Iron smelting was developed in the area between [[Lake Chad]] and the [[African Great Lakes]] between 1000 and 600 BCE, long before it reached Egypt.

Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]. ISBN 0-19-521921-X.&lt;/ref&gt;==Antiquity==The ancient history of [[North Africa]] is inextricably linked to that of the [[Ancient Near East]]. This is particularly true of [[Ancient Egypt]], and to a lesser extent of [[Nubia]] and [[Ethiopia]] ([[Axumite Kingdom]]).[[Phoenicia]]n cities such as [[Carthage]] were part of the Mediterranean [[Iron Age]] and [[Classical Antiquity]].[[Sub-Saharan Africa]] developed more or less independently in those times.===Ancient Egypt==={{main|Ancient Egypt}}[[Image:Lower Egypt Nomes 01.png|thumb|250px|right|Map of Ancient Egypt and nomes]]After the [[desertification]] of the Sahara, settlement became concentrated in the [[Nile Valley]], where numerous sacral chiefdoms appeared. The regions with the largest population pressure were in the delta region of [[Lower Egypt]], in [[Upper Egypt]], and also along the [[Cataracts of the Nile|second and third cataracts]] of the [[Dongola]] reach of the Nile in Nubia. This population pressure and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of bureaucracies among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was [[Ta-Seti]], founded around  3500 BCE. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout upper and lower Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (2002), pp. 143-46.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[pyramids of Giza]], symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt.]]Later consolidation of the chiefdoms into broader political entities began to occur in upper and lower Egypt, culminating into the unification of Egypt into one political entity by [[Narmer]] (Menes) in 3100 BCE. Instead being viewed as a sacral chief, he became a [[Imperial cult|divine king]]. The [[henotheism]], or worship of a single god within a polytheistic system, practiced in the sacral chiefdoms along upper and lower Egypt, became the polytheistic religion of ancient Egypt. Bureaucracies became more centralized under the pharaohs, run by viziers, governors, tax collectors, generals, artists, and  technicians. They engaged in tax collecting, organizing of labor for major public works, and building irrigation systems, [[pyramid]]s, temples, and canals. During the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2620-2480BCE), long distance trade was developed, with the [[Levant]] for timber, with Nubia for gold and skins, with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] for [[frankincense]], and also with the western Libyan territories. For most of the [[Old Kingdom]], Egypt developed her fundamental systems, institutions and culture, always through the central bureaucracy and by the divinity of the [[Pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Basil (1991), ''Africa In History: Themes and Outlines'', pp. 30-33. Revised and expanded ed. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster ISBN 0-684-82667-4&lt;/ref&gt;After the third millennium BCE, Egypt started to extend direct military and political control over her southern and western neighbors. By 2200 BCE, the Old Kingdom's stability was undermined by rivalry among the governors of the [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] who challenged the power of pharaohs and by invasions of Asiatics into the delta. The [[First Intermediate Period]] had begun, a time of political division and uncertainty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33&quot;&gt;Davidson (1991), pp. 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt;By 2130, the period of stagnation was ended by [[Mentuhotep I|Mentuhotep]], the first Pharaoh of the 11th dynasty, and the emergence of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]. Pyramid building resumed, long-distance trade re-emerged, and the center of power moved from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Connections with the southern regions of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], Wawat and Irthet at the second cataract were made stronger. Then came the [[Second Intermediate Period]], with the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] on horse-drawn chariots and utilizing bronze weapons, a technology heretofore unseen in Egypt. Horse-drawn chariots soon spread to the west in the inhabitable Sahara and [[North Africa]]. The Hyksos failed to hold on to their Egyptian territories and were absorbed by Egyptian society. This eventually led to one of Egypt's most powerful phases, the [[New Kingdom]] (1580&amp;ndash;1080 BCE), with the [[Eighteenth Dynasty]]. Egypt became a superpower controlling Nubia and [[Palestine]] while exerting political influence on the Libyans to the West and on the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33&quot;/&gt;As before, the New Kingdom ended with invasion from the west by Libyan princes, leading to the [[Third Intermediate Period]]. Beginning with [[Shoshenq I]], the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] was established. It ruled for two centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33&quot;/&gt;To the south, Nubian independence and strength was being reasserted. This reassertion led to the conquest of Egypt by Nubia, begun by [[Kashta]] and completed by [[Piye]] (Pianhky, 751-730 BCE) and [[Shabaka]] (716-695 BCE). This was the birth of the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] of Egypt. The Nubians tried to re-establish Egyptian traditions and customs. They ruled Egypt for a hundred years. This was ended by an [[Neo-Assyrian empire|Assyrian]] invasion, with [[Taharqa]] experiencing the full might of Assyrian iron weapons. The Nubian pharaoh [[Tantamani]] was the last of the Twenty-fifth dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33&quot;/&gt;When the Assyrians and Nubians left, a new [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] emerged from [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]]. It lasted until 525 BCE, when Egypt was invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Unlike the Assyrians, the Persians stayed. In 332, Egypt was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. This was the beginning of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], which ended with Roman conquest in 30 BCE. Pharaonic Egypt had come to an end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33&quot;/&gt;====Ancient Greek influence====Greeks founded the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in [[Ancient Libya]] around [[631 BC]]. [[Cyrenaica]] became a flourishing colony, though being hemmed in on all sides by absolute desert it had little or no influence on inner Africa. The Greeks, however, exerted a powerful influence in Egypt. To [[Alexander the Great]] the city of [[Alexandria]] owes its foundation ([[332 BC]]), and under the Hellenistic dynasty of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] attempts were made to penetrate southward, and in this way was obtained some knowledge of Ethiopia.===Nubia==={{main|Kerma culture|Kingdom of Kush}}[[Image:Kushite empire 700bc.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Kingdom of Kush|Nubian Empire]] at its greatest extent]]Around 3500 BCE, one of  the first sacral kingdoms to arise in the Nile was Ta-Seti, located in northern Nubia. Ta-Seti was a  powerful sacral kingdom in the Nile Valley at the 1st and 2nd cataracts that exerted an influence over nearby chiefdoms. Based on its pictorial representation, it claimed to have ruled over Upper Egypt. Ta-Seti traded as far  as [[Syro-Palestine]], as well as with Egypt. Ta-Seti exported gold, copper, ostrich feathers, [[ebony]] and [[ivory trade|ivory]] to the [[Old Kingdom]]. By the 32nd century BCE, Ta-Seti was in decline. After the unification of Egypt by [[Narmer]] in 3100 BCE, Ta-Seti was invaded by the Pharaoh [[Hor-Aha]] of  the [[First Dynasty]], destroying the final remnants of the kingdom. Ta-Seti is affiliated with [[A-Group]] culture known to archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (2002), pp. 144, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Naqa Apedamak temple.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Nubian Temple of [[Apedemak]], Naqa]]Small sacral kingdoms continued to dot the Nubian portion of the Nile for centuries after 3000 BCE. Around the latter part of the third millennium, there was further consolidation of the sacral kingdoms. Two kingdoms in particular emerged: the Sai kingdom, immediately south of Egypt, and [[Kingdom of Kerma]] at the third cataract. Sometime around the 18th century BCE, the Kingdom of Kerma conquered the Kingdom of Sai, becoming a serious rival to Egypt. Kerma occupied a territory from the first cataract to the confluences of the [[Blue Nile]], [[White Nile]], and [[River Atbara]]. About 1575 to 1550 BCE, during the latter part of the [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]], the Kingdom of Kerma invaded Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya.[http://wysinger.homestead.com/article10.html Tomb Reveals Ancient Egypt's Humiliating Secret], ''The Times''{London}, 28 July 2003(Monday).&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Kerma allied itself with the [[Hyksos]] invasion of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (2002), pp. 148&amp;ndash;151.&lt;/ref&gt;Egypt eventually re-energized under the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eigthteenth Dynasty]] and conquered the Kingdom of Kerma or [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], ruling it for almost 500 years. The Kushites were Egyptianized during this period.  By 1100 BCE, the Egyptians had withdrawn from Kush. The region regained independence and reasserted its culture. Kush built a new religion around [[Amun]] and made [[Napata]] its spiritual center. In 730 BCE, the Kingdom of Kush invaded Egypt, taking over [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and beginning  the Nubian Empire. The empire extended from Palestine to the confluences of the Blue Nile, the White Nile, and River Atbara.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;In 760 BCE, the Kushites were expelled from Egypt by iron-wielding Assyrians. Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to [[Meröe]], developing into a new Nubian culture. Initially Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of iron-making and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing was replaced by the [[Meroitic alphabet]]. The lion god [[Apedemak]] was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods. Trade links to the [[Red Sea]] increased, linking Nubia with Mediterranean [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Its architecture and art became more unique, with pictures of lions, ostriches, giraffes, and elephants. Eventually with the rise of [[Aksum]], Nubia's trade links were broken and it suffered environmental degradation from the tree cutting required for iron production. In 350 CE, the Aksumite king [[Ezana]] brought Meröe to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt;===Carthage==={{main|Ancient Carthage}}[[File:Carthaginianempire.PNG|thumb|250px|Carthaginian Empire]]The Egyptians referred to the people west of the Nile, ancestral to the [[Berber people|Berbers]], as [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]]. The Libyans were agriculturalists like the [[Mauri (people)|Mauri]] of [[Morocco]] and the [[Numidians]] of central and eastern [[Algeria]] and [[Tunis]]. They were also nomadic, having the horse, and occupied the arid pastures and desert, like the [[Gaetuli]]. Berber desert nomads were typically in conflict with Berber coastal agriculturalists.&lt;ref&gt;Iliffe, John (2007), ''Africans: The History of a Continent'', p. 30. 2nd ed. New York:Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-68297-8.&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Phoenicians]] were seamen of the [[Mediterranean]]. They were in constant search for valuable metals like copper, gold, tin, and lead. Soon they began to populate the [[North African]] coast with settlements, trading and mixing with the native Berber population. In 814 BCE, Phoenicians from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] established the city of [[Carthage]]. By 600 BCE, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the [[Mediterranean]], largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered the growth of the Berber kingdoms, [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]]. Around 500 BCE, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with sub-Saharan Africa. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the [[Garamantes]] of [[Fes|Fez]], who raided caravans. Salt and metal goods were traded for gold, slaves, beads, and ivory.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 63-65.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins of Carthage]]The [[Carthaginians]] were rivals to the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Carthage fought three wars with Rome: the [[First Punic War]] (264 to 241 BCE), over [[Sicily]]; the [[Second Punic War]] (218 to 201 BCE), in which [[Hannibal]] invaded Europe; and the [[Third Punic War]] (149 to 146 BCE). Carthage lost the first two wars, and in the third it was destroyed, becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]], with the Berber Kingdom of Numidia assisting Rome. The Roman province of Africa became a major agricultural supplier of wheat, [[olives]], and [[olive oil]] to imperial Rome via exorbitant taxation. Two centuries later, Rome brought the Berber kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania under its authority. In the 420s CE, [[Vandals]] invaded North Africa and Rome lost her territories. The Berber kingdoms subsequently regained their independence.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Christianity]] gained a foothold in Africa at [[Alexandria]] in the 1st century CE and spread to northwest Africa. By 313 CE, with the [[Edict of Milan]], all of Roman [[North Africa]] was Christian. Egyptians adopted [[Monophysite]] Christianity and formed the independent [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. Berbers adopted [[Donatist]] Christianity. Both groups refused to accept the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]].====Role of the Berbers===={{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}As Carthaginian power grew; its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. [[Berber people|Berber]] civilization was already at a stage in which [[agriculture]], manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others. By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed one of the largest element, with Gauls, of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers participated from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. Berbers succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]]; in 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohad]]s and [[Almoravid]]s more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until AD 24, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].===Somalia==={{See|Maritime history of Somalia|History of Somalia}}[[File:Qableh1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ruins of [[Qa'ableh]], an early center of [[Somali people|Somali]] civilization.]]The ancestors of the [[Somali people]] were an important link in the [[Horn of Africa]] connecting the region's commerce with the rest of the ancient world. Somali sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of [[frankincense]], [[myrrh]] and spices, all of which were valuable luxuries to the [[Ancient Egyptians]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]] and [[Babylonians]].&lt;ref&gt;Phoenicia, pg. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Jeanne, and John Hulburd, ''The Aromatherapy Book'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;In the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]], several flourishing Somali city-states such as [[Opone]], [[Cape Guardafui|Mosyllon]] and [[Berbera|Malao]] competed with the [[Sabaean]]s, [[Parthia]]ns and [[Axumite Empire|Axumites]] for the rich [[India|Indo]]-[[Greco-Roman]] trade.&lt;ref&gt;Vine, Peter, ''Oman in History'', p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;===Roman North Africa==={{split-section|North Africa during Antiquity|date=February 2011}}{{see|Africa Province|Numidia|Roman Libya}}[[File:Roman Africa.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Northern Africa under Roman rule.]]Increases in urbanization and in the area under cultivation during Roman rule caused wholesale dislocations of the Berber society. Nomad tribes were forced to settle or move from traditional rangelands. Sedentary tribes lost their autonomy and connection with the land. Berber opposition to the Roman presence was nearly constant. The Roman emperor [[Trajan]] established a frontier in the south by encircling the Aurès and [[Nemencha]] mountains and building a line of forts from Vescera (modern [[Biskra]]) to Ad Majores ([[Hennchir Besseriani]], southeast of Biskra). The defensive line extended at least as far as Castellum Dimmidi (modern [[Messaad]], southwest of Biskra), Roman Algeria's southernmost fort. Romans settled and developed the area around Sitifis (modern [[Sétif]]) in the 2nd century, but farther west the influence of Rome did not extend beyond the coast and principal military roads until much later.The Roman military presence of North Africa was relatively small, consisting of about 28,000 troops and auxiliaries in [[Numidia]] and the two [[Mauretania]]n provinces. Starting in the 2nd century AD, these garrisons were manned mostly by local inhabitants.Aside from Carthage, urbanization in North Africa came in part with the establishment of settlements of veterans under the Roman emperors [[Claudius]], Nerva, and Trajan. In Algeria such settlements included [[Tipasa]], Cuicul or Curculum (modern [[Djemila]], northeast of Sétif), Thamugadi (modern [[Timgad]], southeast of Sétif), and Sitifis (modern [[Setif]]). The prosperity of most towns depended on agriculture. Called the &quot;granary of the empire,&quot; North Africa was one of the largest exporters of grain in the empire, which was exported to the provinces which did not produce cereals, like Italy and Greece. Other crops included fruit, figs, grapes, and beans. By the 2nd century AD, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item.The beginnings of the decline was less serious in North Africa than elsewhere. There were uprisings, however. In AD 238, landowners rebelled unsuccessfully against the emperor's fiscal policies. Sporadic tribal revolts in the Mauretanian mountains followed from 253 to 288. The towns also suffered economic difficulties, and building activity almost ceased.The towns of Roman North Africa had a substantial Jewish population. Some Jews had been deported from [[Judea]] or [[Palestine]] in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD for rebelling against Roman rule; others had come earlier with [[Punic]] settlers. In addition, a number of Berber tribes had converted to Judaism.[[Christianity]] arrived in the 2nd century and soon gained converts in the towns and among slaves. More than eighty bishops, some from distant frontier regions of Numidia, attended the Council of [[Carthage]] in 256. By the end of the 4th century, the settled areas had become [[Christianized]], and some Berber tribes had converted en masse.A division in the church that came to be known as the [[Donatist]] controversy began in 313 among Christians in North Africa. The Donatists stressed the holiness of the church and refused to accept the authority to administer the sacraments of those who had surrendered the scriptures when they were forbidden under the Emperor [[Diocletian]]. The Donatists also opposed the involvement of [[Emperor Constantine]] in church affairs in contrast to the majority of Christians who welcomed official imperial recognition.The occasionally violent controversy has been characterized as a struggle between opponents and supporters of the Roman system. The most articulate North African critic of the Donatist position, which came to be called a heresy, was Augustine, bishop of [[Hippo Regius]]. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] maintained that the unworthiness of a minister did not affect the validity of the sacraments because their true minister was Christ. In his sermons and books Augustine, who is considered a leading exponent of Christian dogma, evolved a theory of the right of orthodox Christian rulers to use force against schismatics and heretics. Although the dispute was resolved by a decision of an imperial commission in Carthage in 411, Donatist communities continued to exist as late as the 6th century.The decline in trade weakened Roman control. Independent kingdoms emerged in mountainous and desert areas, towns were overrun, and Berbers, who had previously been pushed to the edges of the Roman Empire, returned.[[Belisarius]], general of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] based in [[Constantinople]], landed in North Africa in 533 with 16,000 men and within a year destroyed the Vandal kingdom. Local opposition delayed full Byzantine control of the region for twelve years, however, and when imperial control came, it was but a shadow of the control exercised by Rome. Although an impressive series of fortifications were built, Byzantine rule was compromised by official corruption, incompetence, military weakness, and lack of concern in Constantinople for African affairs, which made it an easy target for the Arabs during for [[Muslim Conquests]]  . As a result, many rural areas reverted to Berber rule.===Aksum==={{main|Aksumite Empire}}[[File:LocationAksumiteEmpire.png|thumb|right|200px|Aksumite Empire]][[File:Stela aksum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aksum Obelisk, symbol of the Aksumite civilization.]]The earliest state in [[Eritrea]] and northern [[Ethiopia]] was [[D'mt]], dated around the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. D'mt traded through the Red Sea with Egypt and the Mediterranean, providing frankincense. By the fifth and 3rd centuries, D'mt had declined, and several successor states took its place. Later there was greater trade with southern Arabia, mainly with the port of Saba. [[Adulis]] became an important commercial center in the [[Ethiopian highlands]]. The interaction of the peoples in the two regions, the southern Arabia [[Sabaean]]s and the northern Ethiopians, resulted in the [[Ge'ez]] culture and language and eventual development of the [[Ge'ez script]]. Trade links increased and expanded from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, with Egypt, Greece, and Rome, to the [[Black Sea]], and to [[Persia]], [[India]], and [[China]]. Aksum was known throughout those lands. By the 5th century BCE, the region was very prosperous, exporting ivory, hippopotamus hides, gold dust, spices, and live elephants. It imported silver, gold, olive oil,  and wine. Aksum manufactured glass crystal, brass, and copper for export. A powerful Aksum emerged, unifying parts of eastern Sudan, northern [[Ethiopia]] ([[Tigray Region|Tigre]]), and [[Eritrea]]. Its kings built stone palatial buildings and were buried under megalithic monuments. By 300 CE, Aksum was minting its own coins in silver and gold.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert O., and James M. Burns (2007), ''A History of Sub-Saharan Africa'', pp. 66&amp;ndash;71. [[New York City]]: [[Cambridge University Press]]. ISBN 978-0-521-68708-9.&lt;/ref&gt;In 331 CE, King [[Ezana]] (320&amp;ndash;350 CE) was converted to Monophysite Christianity supposedly by [[Frumentius]] and Aedesius, who were stranded on the Red Sea coast. Some scholars believed the process was more complex and gradual than a simple conversion. Around 350, the time Ezana sacked Meroe, the Syrian monastic tradition took root within the Ethiopian church.&lt;ref&gt;Iliffe (2007), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;In the 6th century, Aksum was powerful enough to add Saba on the Arabian peninsula to her empire. At the end of the 6th century, the Persians pushed Aksum out of peninsula. With the spread of Islam through western Asia and northern Africa, Aksum's trading networks in the Mediterranean were closed. The Red Sea trade diminished as it was diverted to the [[Persian Gulf]] and dominated by Arabs, causing Aksum to decline. By 800 CE, the capital was moved south into the interior highlands, and Aksum was much diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 66&amp;ndash;71.&lt;/ref&gt;===West Africa and Bantu Expansion==={{See|Tichitt|Djenné|Nok culture|Bantu expansion}}[[Image:Bantu Phillipson.png|thumb|250px|'''1''' = 3000 - 1500 BCE origin&lt;br /&gt;'''2''' = c. 1500 BCE first migrations&lt;br /&gt;{{nbsp|4}} '''2.a''' = Eastern Bantu,{{nbsp|2}}'''2.b''' = Western Bantu&lt;br /&gt;'''3''' = 1000 - 500 BCE [[Urewe]] nucleus of Eastern Bantu&lt;br /&gt;'''4''' - '''7''' = southward advance&lt;br /&gt;'''9''' = 500 BCE - 0 Congo nucleus&lt;br /&gt;'''10''' = 0 - 1000 CE last phase&lt;ref&gt;after Derek Nurse und Gérard Philippson: The Bantu Languages.

Archaeology points to sizable urban populations in West Africa beginning in the 2nd millennium BCE. Symbiotic trade relations developed before the [[trans-Saharan trade]], in response to the opportunities afforded by north-south diversity in ecosystems across deserts, grasslands, and forests. The agriculturists received salt from the desert nomads. The desert nomads acquired meat and other foods from pastoralists and farmers of the grasslands and from fishermen on the [[Niger River]]. The forest dwellers provided furs and meat.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Nok sculpture Louvre 70-1998-11-1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nok sculpture, terracotta, [[Louvre]]]][[Tichit]] (Dhar Tichitt) was prominent among the early urban centers, dated to 2000 BCE, in present day [[Mauritania]]. About 500 stone settlements litter the region in the former savannah of the Sahara. Its inhabitants fished and grew millet. Around 300 BCE, the region became more desiccated and the settlements began to decline, most likely relocating to [[Koumbi Saleh]]. From the type of architecture and pottery, it is believed that Tichit was related to the subsequent [[Ghana Empire]]. [[Djenne|Old Jenne]] (Djenne) began to be settled around 300 BCE, producing iron and with sizable population, evidenced in crowded cemeteries. Living structures were made of sun-dried mud. By 250 BCE, Jenne was a large, thriving market town.&lt;ref&gt;Iliffe, John (2007). pp. 49,50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;Farther south, in central [[Nigeria]], around 1000 BCE, the Nok culture developed on the [[Jos Plateau]]. It was a highly centralized community. The Nok people produced miniature lifelike representations in [[terracotta]], including human heads, elephants, and other animals. By 500 BCE, they were smelting iron. By 200 CE, the Nok culture had vanished. Based on stylistic similarities with Nok terracottas, the bronze figurines of [[Ife]] and [[Benin]] are believed to be continuation of the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Bantu expansion]] was a critical movement of people in African history and the settling of the continent. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] is a branch of the [[Niger–Congo]] family. The expansion began in the second millennium BCE, from [[Cameroon]]. Its first thrust was eastward to the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes region]] in the second millennium BCE. In the first millennium BCE, Bantu languages spread from the Great Lakes to southern and east Africa. An early expansion was south to the upper [[Zambezi]] valley in the 2nd century BCE. Then, Bantu speakers pushed westward to the savannahs of present-day [[Angola]] and eastward into [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]] in the 1st century CE. The second thrust from the Great Lakes was eastward, 2,000 years ago, expanding to the [[Indian Ocean]] coast and [[Tanzania]]. The eastern group eventually met the southern migrants from the Great Lakes in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Both groups continued southward, with eastern groups continuing to [[Mozambique]] and reaching [[Maputo]] in the 2nd century CE, and expanding as far as [[Durban]]. By the later first millennium CE, the expansion had reached the [[Great Kei River]] of South Africa. [[Sorghum]], a major Bantu crop, could not thrive under the winter rainfall of [[Namibia]] and the western Cape. [[Khoisan]] people inhabited the remaining parts of southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Iliffe (2007), pp. 34, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;==500 to 1800=====North Africa=======Maghreb (the West)===={{See|Almoravid Dynasty|Almohad Dynasty|Saadi Dynasty|Alaouite Dynasty}}[[Image:Almohad1200.png|thumb|250px|right|Almohad Empire, c. 1200.]][[File:Kairouan Mosque Stitched Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (also known as the Mosque of Uqba), first built in 670 by the Umayyad general Uqba Ibn Nafi, is the oldest and most prestigious mosque in the Maghreb and North Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=mosque+kairouan+oldest+in+north+africa&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=1dkVTbvFE9Sy8QPny9z-Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mosque%20kairouan%20oldest%20in%20north%20africa&amp;f=false Hans Kung, ''Tracing the Way : Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions''.

By the 10th century, the majority of the population of North Africa was Muslim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67&quot;&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 65–67, 72–75.&lt;/ref&gt;By the 9th century CE, the unity brought about by the Islamic conquest of [[North Africa]] and the expansion of Islamic culture came to an end. Conflict arose as to who should be the successor of the prophet. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]]s had initially taken control of the [[Caliphate]], with their capital at [[Damascus]]. Later, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s had taken control, moving the capital to [[Baghdad]]. The [[Berber people]], being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to [[Arab]] exclusivity in orthodox Islam, adopted [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] Islam, both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Numerous Kharijite kingdoms came and fell during the 8th and 9th centuries, asserting their independence from Baghdad. In the early 10th century, Shi'ite groups from Syria, claiming descent from Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah|Fatima]], founded the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] in the [[Maghreb]]. By 950, they had conquered all of the Maghreb and by 969 all of Egypt. They had immediately broken away from Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 75, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;In an attempt to bring about a purer form of Islam among the [[Zenaga people|Sanhaja]] Berbers, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] founded the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in present-day [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], practiced an indigenous religion along side Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the [[Lamtuna]] Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the [[Zenata]] Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar|Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the sons of the Lamtuna chief,  the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], because it was too big to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the [[Ghana Empire]] in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, Kevin (2005). p 90.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Safi minaret.png|250px|thumb|left|The Almohad minaret in Safi]]During the 10th through 13th centuries, there was a large-scale movement of  bedouins out of the Arabian Peninsula. About 1050, a quarter of a million Arab nomads from Egypt moved into the Maghreb. Those following the northern coast were referred to as [[Banu Hilal]]. Those going south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] were the [[Banu Sulaym]]. This movement spread the use of the Arabic language and hastened the decline of the Berber language and the Arabisation of North Africa. Later an Arabised Berber group, the Hawwara, went south to Nubia via Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 156, 157&lt;/ref&gt;In the 1140s, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] declared jihad on the [[Almoravids]], charging them with decadence and corruption. He united the northern Berbers against the Almoravids, overthrowing them and forming the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Empire. During this period, the Maghreb became thoroughly Islamised and saw the spread of literacy, the development of algebra, and the use of the number zero and decimals. By the 13th century, the Almohad states had split into three rival states. Muslim states were largely extinguished in [[Spain]] by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Aragon]], and [[Portugal]]. Around 1415, Portugal engaged in a ''reconquista'' of North Africa by capturing [[Ceuta]], and in later centuries Spain and Portugal acquired other ports on the North African coast. In 1492, Spain defeated Muslims in [[Granada]], effectively ending eight centuries of  Muslim domination in southern Iberia.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 88-92.&lt;/ref&gt;Portugal and Spain took the ports of [[Tangiers]], [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]], and [[Tunis]]. This put them in direct competition with the [[Ottoman Empire]], which re-took the ports using Turkish corsairs (pirates and privateers). The Turkish corsairs would use the ports for raiding Christian ships, a major source of booty for the towns. Technically, North Africa was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but only the coastal towns were fully under [[Istanbul]]'s control. Tripoli benefited from trade with [[Borno State|Borno]]. The [[pashas]] of Tripoli traded horses, firearms, and armor via Fez with the sultans of the [[Bornu Empire]] for slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 166,167&lt;/ref&gt;In the 16th century, an Arab nomad tribe that claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadis]], conquered and united [[Morocco]]. They prevented the Ottoman Empire from reaching to the Atlantic and expelled Portugal from Morocco's western coast. [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought the state to the height of its power. He invaded [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]] in 1591, to control the gold trade, which had been diverted to the western coast of Africa for European ships and to the east, to Tunis. Morocco's hold on Songhay diminished in the 17th century. In 1603, after Ahmad's death, the kingdom split into the two sultanates of [[Fes]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Later it was reunited by [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al-Rashid]], founder of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] (1672&amp;ndash;1727). His brother and successor, [[Ismail ibn Sharif]](1672–1727), strengthen the unity of  the country by importing slaves from the Sudan to build up the military.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 167&amp;ndash;168.&lt;/ref&gt;====Egypt===={{See|List of rulers of Egypt}}[[File:FatimidCaliphate969.png|right|250px|thumb|Fatimid Caliphate]]In 642 CE, Arab [[Muslims]] conquered [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67&quot;/&gt;Egypt under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was prosperous. Dams and canals were repaired, and wheat, barley, flax, and cotton production increased. Egypt became a major producer of linen and cotton cloth. Its Mediterranean and Red Sea trade increased. Egypt also minted a gold currency called the Fatimid dinar, which was used for international trade. The bulk of revenues came from taxing the [[fellah]]in (peasant farmers), and taxes were high. Tax collecting was leased to [[Berber people|Berber]] overlords, who were soldiers who had taken part in the Fatimid conquest in 969 CE. The overlords paid a share to the caliphs and retained what was left. Eventually, they became landlords and constituted a settled land aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;To fill the military ranks, [[Mamluk]] Turkish slave cavalry and Sudanese slave infantry were used. Berber freemen were also recruited. In 1150s, tax revenues from farms diminished. The soldiers revolted and wreaked havoc in the countryside, slowed trade, and diminished the power and authority of the Fatimid caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;During the 1160s, Fatimid Egypt came under threat from [[Crusades|European crusaders]]. Out of this threat, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general named [[Saladin|Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb]] (Saladin), with a small band of professional soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and recaptured Jerusalem in 1187. On the death of the Fatimid caliph in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the [[Ayyubid Dynasty]]. Under his rule, Egypt returned to [[Sunni]] Islam, [[Cairo]] became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from [[Turkey]] and southern [[Russia]] for military service. Support for the military was tied to the ''iqta'', a form of land taxation in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 158,159&lt;/ref&gt;Over time, Mamluk slave soldiers became a very powerful landed aristocracy, to the point of  getting rid of  the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a Mamluk dynasty. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as ''amirs''. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in 1260 at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. Eventually the ''iqta'' system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their ''iqta'' as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of handguns and cannons.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 159&amp;ndash;161.&lt;/ref&gt;With the rise of  the [[Ottoman Empire]], Egypt was easily defeated. In 1517, Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire. Istanbul revived the ''iqta'' system. Trade was reestablished in the Red Sea, but it could not completely connect with Indian Ocean trade because of growing Portuguese presence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, hereditary Mamluks regained power. The leading Mamluks were referred to as ''[[bey]]s''. [[Pasha]]s, or viceroys, represented the Istanbul government in name only, operating independently. During the 18th century, dynasties of pashas became established. The government was weak and corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1798, [[Napoleon]] invaded Egypt. The local forces had little ability to resist the French conquest. However, Britain and the Ottoman Empire were able to remove French occupation in 1801. These events marked the beginning of 19th-century Anglo-Franco rivalry over Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;===Horn of Africa=======Somalia====[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Citadel]] of [[Gondershe|Gondershe, Somalia]] was an important city in the medieval [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Ajuuraan State|Ajuuraan Empire]].]]The [[History of Islam|birth of Islam]] opposite Somalia's Red Sea coast meant that Somali merchants and sailors living on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted [[Arab]] Muslim trading partners. With the migration of Muslim families from the [[Islamic world]] to Somalia in the early centuries of Islam, and the peaceful conversion of the Somali population by [[Islam in Somalia|Somali Muslim scholars]] in the following centuries, the ancient city-states eventually transformed into Islamic [[Mogadishu]], [[Berbera]], [[Zeila]], [[Barawa]] and [[Merka]], which were part of the ''Berber'' (the medieval Arab term for the ancestors of the modern Somalis) civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laitin&quot;&gt;David D.

They would rule for 200 years. Makuria was above the [[Cataracts of the Nile|third cataract]], along the Dongola Reach with its capital at [[Dongola]]. Nobadia  was to the north with its capital at [[Faras]], and [[Alodia]] was to the south with its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. Makuria eventually absorbed Nobadia. The people of the region converted to [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christianity]] around 500 to 600 CE. The church initially started writing in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], then in Greek, and finally in [[Old Nubian]], a [[Nilo-Saharan]] language. The church was aligned with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (2002), p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;By 641, Egypt was conquered by Muslim Arabs. This effectively blocked Christian Nubia and Aksum from Mediterranean Christendom. In 651-652, Arabs from Egypt invaded Christian Nubia. Nubian archers soundly defeated the invaders. The [[Bakt|Baqt (or Bakt) Treaty]] was drawn, recognizing Christian Nubia and regulating trade. The treaty controlled relations between Christian Nubia and Islamic Egypt for almost six hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;By the 13th century, Christian Nubia began its decline. The authority of the monarchy was diminished by the church and nobility. Arab [[bedouin]] tribes began to infiltrate Nubia, causing further havoc. ''[[Fakir]]s'' (holy men) practicing [[Sufism]] introduced Islam into Nubia. By 1366, Nubia had become divided into petty fiefdoms when she was invaded by [[Mamelukes]]. During the 15th century, Nubia was open to Arab immigration. Arab nomads intermingled with the population and introduced the Arabic culture and language. By the 16th century, [[Makuria]] and [[Nobadia]] had been Islamized. During the 16th century, Abdallah Jamma headed an Arab confederation that destroyed Soba, capital of Alodia, the last holdout of Christian Nubian. Later Alodia would fall under the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns 2007, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;During the 15th century, [[Funj people|Funj]] herders migrated north to [[Alodia]] and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at [[Sennar]] under [[Badi II|Badi II Abu Daqn]] (c. 1644&amp;ndash;1680). By end of the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They pushed their empire westward to [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]]. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under [[Badi IV]] (1724–1762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1805–1849), Pasha of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Page, Willie F.(2001).

They traded with Arabia, India, Persia, and China.The Portuguese arrived in 1498. On a mission to economically control and Christianize the Swahili coast, the Portuguese attacked Kilwa first in 1505 and other cities later. Because of Swahili resistance, the Portuguese attempt at establishing commercial control was never successful. By the late 17th century, Portuguese authority on the Swahili coast began to diminish. With the help of [[Oman]]i Arabs, by 1729 the Portuguese presence had been removed. The Swahili coast eventually became part of the [[Sultanate of Oman]]. Trade recovered, but it did not regain the levels of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Page, Willie F.(2001). p. 263,264&lt;/ref&gt;====Madagascar and Merina====[[Madagascar]] was apparently first settled by [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] speakers from southeast Asia before the 6th century CE and subsequently by [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] speakers from the east African mainland in the sixth or 7th century, according to archaeological and linguistic data. The Austronesians introduced banana and rice cultivation, and the Bantu speakers introduced cattle and other farming practices. About 1000, Arab and Indian trade settlement were started in northern Madagascar to exploit the Indian Ocean trade.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 14th century, Islam was introduced on the island by traders. Madagascar functioned in the East African medieval period as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as [[Sofala]], [[Kilwa]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Zanzibar]].Several kingdoms emerged after the 15th century: the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava Kingdom]] (16th century) on the west coast, [[Tsitambala]] Kingdom (17th century) on the east coast, and [[Merina]] (15th century) in the central highlands. By the 19th century, Merina controlled the whole island. In 1500, the Portuguese were the first Europeans on the island, raiding the trading settlements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lye, Keith2002. pp. 242,243&quot;&gt;Lye, Keith(2002). pp. 242,243&lt;/ref&gt;The British and later the French arrived. During the latter part of the 17th century, Madagascar was a popular transit point for pirates. [[Radama I of Madagascar|Radama I]] (1810–1828) invited Christian missionaries in the early 19th century. Queen [[Ranavalona I]] &quot;the Cruel&quot; (1828–61) banned the practice of Christianity in the kingdom, and an estimated 150,000 Christians perished. Under [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]] (1861–1863), Madagascar took a French orientation, with great commercial concession given to the French. In 1895, in the second [[Franco-Hova War]], the French invaded Madagascar, taking over [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez)  and declaring Madagascar a protectorate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lye, Keith2002. pp. 242,243&quot;/&gt;====Lake Plateau states and empires=========Kitara and Bunyoro=====[[File:Realkitara.JPG|thumb|250px|Lake Plateau states]]By 1000 CE, numerous states had arisen on the [[Lake Plateau]] among the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] of East Africa. Cattle herding, cereal growing, and banana cultivation were the economic mainstays of these states. The [[Ntusi]] and [[Bigo]] earthworks are representative of one of the first states, the [[Bunyoro kingdom]], which oral tradition stipulates was part of the [[Empire of Kitara]] that dominated the whole lakes region. A [[Luo peoples|Luo]] ethnic elite, from the Bito clan, ruled over the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Nyoro people]]. The society was essentially Nyoro in its culture, based on the evidence from pottery, settlement patterns, and economic specialization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2007 pp. 122-123&quot;&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 122&amp;ndash;123.&lt;/ref&gt;The Bito clan claimed legitimacy by being descended from the Bachwezi clan, who were said to have ruled the Empire of Kitara.

The ancestors of the Ganda may have migrated to the northwest of [[Lake Victoria]] as early as 1000 BCE. Buganda was ruled by the ''[[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]]'' with a ''bataka'' composed of the clan heads. Over time, the ''kabakas'' diluted the authority of the ''bataka'', with Buganda becoming a centralized monarchy. By the 16th century, Buganda was engaged in expansion but had a serious rival in [[Bunyoro]]. By the 1870s, Buganda was a wealthy nation-state. The ''kabaka'' ruled with his ''kukiko'' (council of minister). Buganda had a naval fleet of a hundred vessels, each manned by thirty men. Buganda supplanted Bunyoro as the most important state in the region. However, by the early 20th century, Buganda became a province of the British [[Uganda Protectorate]].&lt;ref&gt;Lye, Keith(2002). p. 121,122.&lt;/ref&gt;=====Rwanda=====Southeast of Bunyoro, near [[Lake Kivu]] at the bottom of the western rift, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] was founded, perhaps during the 17th century. [[Tutsi]] (BaTutsi) pastoralists formed the elite, with a king called the ''[[mwami]]''. The [[Hutu]] (BaHutu) were farmers. Both groups spoke the same language, but there were strict social norms against marrying each other and interaction. According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded by Mwami Ruganzu II (Ruganzu Ndori) (c. 1600&amp;ndash;1624), with his capital near [[Kigali]]. It took 200 years to attain a truly centralized kingdom under Mwami [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli IV]] (Kigeri Rwabugiri) (1840–1895). Subjugation of the Hutu proved more difficult than subduing the Tutsi. The last Tutsi chief gave up to Mwami [[Mutara II of Rwanda|Mutara II]] (Mutara Rwogera) (1802–1853) in 1852, but the last Hutu holdout was conquered in the 1920s by Mwami [[Yuhi V of Rwanda|Yuhi V]] (Yuli Musinga) (1896&amp;ndash;1931).&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 123&amp;ndash;124.&lt;/ref&gt;=====Burundi====={{See|List of Kings of Burundi}}South of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the [[Burundian monarchy|Kingdom of Burundi]]. It was founded by the Tutsi chief [[Ntare I Kivimira Savuyimba Semunganzashamba Rushatsi Cambarantama|Ntare Rushatsi]] (c. 1657&amp;ndash;1705). Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and political innovations. Under Mwami [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba|Ntari Rugaamba]] (c. 1795&amp;ndash;1852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one based more on diplomacy than force.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;===West Africa=======Sahelian empires &amp; states=========Ghana=====[[Image:Ghana empire map.png|thumb|250px|right|Ghana at its greatest extent]]The [[Ghana Empire]] may have been an established kingdom as early as the 4th century CE, founded among the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] by Dinge Cisse. Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer [[Al-Farazi]] in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the ''Ghana'' (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the ''Ghana.'' The ''Ghana''  was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the whole society. Ghana converted to Islam around 1050, after conquering [[Aoudaghost]].&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 80&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt;The Ghana Empire grew wealthy by taxing the [[trans-Saharan trade]] that linked [[Tiaret]] and [[Sijilmasa]] to Aoudaghost. Ghana controlled access to the goldfields of [[Bambouk]], southeast of [[Koumbi Saleh]]. A percentage of salt and gold going through its territory was taken. The empire was not involved in production.&lt;ref&gt;Iliffe, John(2007). p. 51&amp;ndash;53.&lt;/ref&gt;By the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It was once thought that the sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several alternative explanations are cited. One important reason is the transfer of the gold trade east to the [[Niger River]] and the [[Taghaza]] Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited is political instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;The empire came to an end in 1230, when [[Takrur]] in northern [[Senegal]] took over the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), pp. 173, 174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml The Story of Africa| BBC World Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;=====Mali====={{See|Keita Dynasty}}[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|250px|Mali Empire at its greatest extent]]The [[Mali Empire]] began in the 13th century CE, when a [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] (Mandingo) leader, [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]] (Lord Lion) of the Keita clan, defeated [[Soumaoro Kanté]], king of the [[Susu people|Sosso]] or southern [[Soninke people|Soninke]], at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. Sundiata continued his conquest from the fertile forests and Niger Valley, east to the Niger Bend, north into the Sahara, and west to the Atlantic Ocean, absorbing the remains of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata took on the title of ''mansa''. He established the capital of his empire at [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83&amp;ndash;84.&lt;/ref&gt;Although the salt and gold trade continued to be important to the Mali Empire, agriculture and pastoralism was also critical. The growing of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and rice was a vital function. On the northern borders of the Sahel, grazing cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were major activities. Mande society was organize around the village and land. A cluster of villages was called a ''kafu'', ruled by a ''farma''. The ''farma'' paid tribute to the ''mansa''. A  dedicated army of elite cavalry and infantry maintained order, commanded by the royal court. A formidable force could be raised from tributary regions, if necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2007 pp. 83-87&quot;&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt;Conversion to Islam was a gradual process. The power of the ''mansa'' depended on upholding traditional beliefs and a spiritual foundation of power. Sundiata initially kept Islam at bay. Later ''mansas'' were devout Muslims but still acknowledged traditional deities and took part in traditional rituals and festivals, which were important to the Mande. Islam became a court religion under Sundiata's son [[Uli I of Mali|Uli I]] (1225&amp;ndash;1270). ''Mansa'' Uli made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], becoming recognized within the Muslim world. The court was staffed with literate Muslims as secretaries and accountants. Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] left vivid descriptions of the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2007 pp. 83-87&quot;/&gt;Mali reached the peak of its power and extent in the 14th century, when [[Musa I of Mali|''Mansa'' Musa]] (1312–1337) made his famous ''hajj'' to Mecca with 500 slaves, each holding a bar of gold worth 500 mitqals.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Basil (1971), ''Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms'', p. 83. [[New York City]]: [[Time Life|Time Life Books]]. [[Library of Congress]] 66-25647.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mansa'' Musa's ''hajj'' devalued gold in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] for a decade. He made a great impression on the minds of the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like [[Al Sahili|Ishal al-Tuedjin]] (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the Islamic world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2007 pp. 83-87&quot;/&gt;The Mali Empire saw an expansion of learning and literacy. In 1285, [[Sakura (mansa)|Sakura]], a freed slave, usurped the throne. This ''mansa'' drove the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] out of [[Timbuktu]] and established it as a center of learning and commerce. The book trade increased, and book copying became a very respectable and profitable profession. Timbuktu and [[Djenné]] became important centers of learning within the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1971), pp. 84&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt;After the reign of [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleyman]] (1341–1360), Mali began its spiral downward. [[Mossi people|Mossi]] cavalry raided the exposed southern border. Tuareg harassed the northern border in order to retake Timbuktu.[[Fula people|Fulani]] (Fulbe) eroded Mali's authority in the west by establing the independent [[Kingdom of Fouta Tooro]], a successor to the kingdom of [[Takrur]]. [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof Empire|Wolof]] alliances were broken. In 1545 to 1546, the [[Songhai Empire]] took [[Niani, Mali Empire|Niani]]. After 1599, the empire lost the [[Bambouk]] goldfields and disintegrated into petty polities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2007 pp. 83-87&quot;/&gt;=====Songhai====={{See|Askiya Dynasty|Sonni Dynasty}}[[Image:SONGHAI empire map.PNG|thumb|right|250px|The Songhai Empire, c. 1500]]The [[Songhai people]] are descended from fishermen on the [[Niger River|Middle Niger River]].

The Songhai speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Sonni Ali]], a Songhai, began his conquest by capturing Timbuktu in 1468 from the Tuareg. He extended the empire to the north, deep into the desert, pushed the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] further south of the Niger, and expanded southwest to Djenne. His army consisted of cavalry and a fleet of canoes. Sonni Ali was not a Muslim, and he was portrayed negatively by Berber-Arab scholars, especially for attacking Muslim Timbuktu. After his death in 1492, his heirs were deposed by General [[Askia Mohammad I|Muhammad Ture]], a Muslim of Soninke origins.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 100&amp;ndash;101.&lt;/ref&gt;Muhammad Ture (1493&amp;ndash;1528) founded the [[Askiya Dynasty]], ''[[askiya]]'' being the title of the king. He consolidated the conquests of Sonni Ali. Islam was used to extend his authority by declaring jihad on the Mossi, reviving the trans-Saharan trade, and having the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid &quot;shadow&quot; caliph]] in Cairo declare him as caliph of Sudan. He established Timbuktu as a great center of Islamic learning. Muhammad Ture expanded the empire by pushing the Tuareg north, capturing Aïr in the east, and capturing salt-producing [[Taghaza]]. He brought the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa states]] into the Songhay trading network. He further centralized the administration of the empire by selecting administrators from loyal servants and families and assigning them to conquered territories. They were responsible for raising local militias. Centralization made Songhay very stable, even during dynastic disputes. [[Leo Africanus]] left vivid descriptions of the empire under Askiya Muhammad. Askiya Muhammad was deposed by his son in 1528. After much rivalry, Muhammad Ture's last son [[Askia Daoud|Askiya Daoud]] (1529&amp;ndash;1582) assumed the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1591, [[Morocco]] invaded the Songhai Empire under [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] in order to secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the [[Battle of Tondibi]], the Songhai army was defeated. The Moroccans captured Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at [[Dendi Kingdom|Dendi]] in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of the Moroccans, who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.Morocco found its venture unprofitable. The gold trade had been diverted to Europeans on the coast. Most of the trans-Saharan trade was now diverted east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. Expensive equipment purchased with gold had to be sent across the Sahara, an unsustainable scenario. The Moroccans who remained married into the population and were referred to as ''[[Arma people|Arma]]'' or ''Ruma''. They established themselves at Timbuktu as a military caste with various fiefs, independent from Morocco. Amid the chaos, other groups began to assert themselves, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] of [[Futa Tooro]] who encroached from the west. The [[Bambara Empire]], one of the states that broke from Songhai, sacked Gao. In 1737, the Tuareg massacred the ''Arma''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2007 pp. 88-89&quot;&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 100&amp;ndash;102, 179&amp;ndash;181.&lt;/ref&gt;=====Kanem-Bornu (Kanembu)====={{See|Sayfawa dynasty}}[[File:Afrika-Kanem-Bornu.png|thumb|right|250px|The farthest extent of the medieval Kanem-Bornu state.]]Around the 9th century CE, the cenral Sudanic Empire of [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]], with its capital at [[Njimi]], was founded by the [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]]-speaking nomads. Kanem arose by engaging in the trans-Saharan trade. It exchanged slaves captured by raiding the south for horses from [[North Africa]], which in turn aided in the acquisition of slaves. By the late 11th century, the Islamic [[Sayfawa Dynasty|Sayfawa (Saifawa) dynasty]] was founded by [[Hummay|Humai (Hummay) ibn Salamna]]. The Sayfawa Dynasty ruled for 771 years, making it one of the longest-lasting dynasties in human history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2007 pp. 88-89&quot;/&gt; In addition to trade, taxation of local farms around Kanem became an source of state income. Kanem reached its peak under ''Mai'' (king) [[Dunama Dabbalemi|Dunama Dibalemi ibn Salma]] (1210–1248). The empire reportedly was able to field 40,000 cavalry, and it extended from [[Fezzan]] in the north to the [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] state in the south. Islam became firmly entrenched in the empire. Pilgrimages to [[Mecca]] were common; [[Cairo]] had hostels set aside specifically for pilgrims from Kanem.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 182&amp;ndash;183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;Around 1400, the Sayfawa Dynasty moved its capital to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]], a tributary state southwest of [[Lake Chad]] with a new capital [[Ngazargamu|Birni Ngarzagamu]]. Overgrazing had caused the pastures of Kanem to become too dry. In addition, political rivalry from the [[Bilala people|Bilala]] clan was becoming intense. Moving to Bornu better situated the empire to exploit the trans-Saharan trade and to widen its network in that trade. Links to the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] states were also established, providing horses and salt from [[Bilma]] for [[Akan people|Akan]] gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington 2005, pp. 183, 184&quot;&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 183&amp;ndash;184.&lt;/ref&gt; Mai [[Ali Gazi|Ali Gazi ibn Dunama]] (c. 1475&amp;ndash;1503) defeated the Bilala, reestablishing complete control of Kanem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins and Burns 2007, p. 91&quot;&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;During the early 16th century, the [[Sayfawa Dynasty]] solidified its hold on the Bornu population after much rebellion. In the latter half of the 16th century, ''Mai'' [[Idris Alooma]] modernized its military, in contrast to the [[Songhai Empire]]. Turkish mercenaries were used to train the military. The Sayfawa Dynasty were the first monarchs south of the Sahara to import firearms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins and Burns 2007, p. 91&quot;/&gt; The empire controlled all of the Sahel from the borders of Darfur in the east to Hausaland to the west. Friendly relationship was established with the [[Ottoman Empire]] via [[Tripoli]]. The ''Mai'' exchanged gifts with the Ottoman sultan.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;During the 17th and 18th centuries, not much is known about Bornu. During the 18th century, it became a center of Islamic learning. However, Bornu's army became outdated by not importing new arms,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington 2005, pp. 183, 184&quot;/&gt; and Kamembu had also begun its decline. The power of the ''mai'' was undermined by droughts and famine that were becoming more intense, internal rebellion in the pastoralist north, growing Hausa power, and the importation of firearms which made warfare more bloody. By 1841, the last ''mai'' was deposed, bringing to an end the long-lived Sayfawa Dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins and Burns 2007, p. 91&quot;/&gt;=====Sokoto Caliphate=====The [[Fula people|Fulani]] were migratory people. They moved from [[Mauritania]] and settled in [[Futa Tooro]], [[Fouta Djallon|Futa Djallon]], and subsequently throughout the rest of West Africa. By the 14th century CE, they had converted to Islam. During the 16th century, they established themselves at [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] in southern [[Mali]]. During the 1670s, they declared jihads on non-Muslims. Several states were formed from these jihadist wars, at Futa Toro, Futa Djallon, Macina, [[Oualia]], and Bundu. The most important of these states was the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] or [[Fulani Empire]].In the city of [[Gobir]], [[Usman dan Fodio]] (1754–1817)  accused the Hausa leadership of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt. In 1804, he launched the [[Fulani War]] as a jihad among a population that was restless about high taxes and discontented with its leaders. Jihad fever swept northern [[Nigeria]], with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]], with [[Sokoto]] as its capital. He retired to teach and write and handed the empire to his son [[Muhammed Bello]]. The Sokoto Caliphate lasted until 1903 when the British conquered northern Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Lye, Keith(2002). p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;====Forest empires and states=========Akan Kingdoms and emergence of Asante Empire====={{See|List of rulers of Asante}}[[File:Kent wove.jpg||thumb|right|250px|[[Ashanti]] Kente cloth patterns]]The Akan speak a Kwa Language. The  speakers of [[Kwa]] languages are believed to have come  from [[East Africa|East]]/[[Central Africa]], before settling in the [[Sahel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html |title=Atlas of the Human Journey |publisher=The Genographic Project |accessdate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 12th century, the Akan Kingdom of [[Bonoman]](Bono State) was established. During the 13th century, when the gold mines in modern day Mali started to dry up, Bonoman and later other Akan states began to rise to promince as the major players in the Gold trade. It was [[Bonoman]] and other Akan kingdoms like [[Denkyira]], [[Akyem]], [[Akwamu]] which were the predecessors to what became the all powerful [[Empire of Ashanti]]. When and how the Ashante got to their present location is debatable. What is known is that by the 17th century an Akan people were identified as living in a state called  Kwaaman. The location of the state was north of Lake Bosomtwe. The states revenue was mainly derived from  trading in gold and [[kola nut]]s and clearing forest to plant [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They built towns between the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra]] and [[Ofin]] rivers. They formed alliances for defense and paid tribute to [[Denkyira]] one of the more powerful Akan states at that time along with Adansi and [[Akwamu]]. During the 16th century, Ashante society experienced sudden changes, including population growth because of cultivation of [[New World]] plants such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]] and an increase in the gold trade between the coast and the north.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;By the 17th century, [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]] (c. 1695&amp;ndash;1717), with help of [[Okomfo Anokye]], unified what became the Ashante into a confederation with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] as a symbol of their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akwamu]], introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch.[[Opoku Ware I]] (1720–1745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding [[Techiman]], Banda, [[Gyaaman]], and [[Gonja]], states on the [[Black Volta]]. Between 1744 and 1745, ''Asantehene'' Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. [[Kusi Obodom]] (1750–1764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. [[Osei Kwadwo]] (1777–1803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. [[Osei Kwame Panyin]] (1777–1803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804–1807), and Osei Bonsu (1807–1824) continued territorial comsolidation and expansion. The Ashante Empire included all of present-day Ghana and large parts of [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;The ''ashantehene'' inherited his position from his mother. He was assisted at the capital, Kumasi, by a civil service of men talented in trade, diplomacy, and the military, with a head called the ''Gyaasehene''. Men from Arabia, Sudan, and Europe were employed in the civil service, all of them appointed by the ''ashantehene''. At the capital and in other towns, the ''ankobia'' or special police were used as bodyguards to the ''ashantehene'', as sources of intelligence, and to suppress rebellion. Communication throughout the empire was maintained via a network of well-kept roads from the coast to the middle Niger and linking together other trade cities.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140&amp;ndash;141.&lt;/ref&gt;For most of the 19th century, the Ashante Empire remained powerful. It was later destroyed in 1900 by British superior weaponry and organization following the four [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;=====Dahomey====={{See|List of rulers of the Fon state of Danhome}}[[Image:Dahomey amazon2.jpg|left|250px|frame|Dahomey Amazons, an all-women fighting unit.]]The [[Dahomey|Dahomey Kingdom]] was founded in the early 17th century CE when the [[Aja people]] of the [[Allada]] kingdom moved northward and settled among the [[Fon people|Fon]]. They began to assert their power a few years later. In so doing they established the Kingdom of Dahomey, with its capital at [[Agbome]]. King [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645&amp;ndash;1685) organized Dahomey into a powerful centralized state. He declared all lands to be owned of the king and subject to taxation. Primogeniture in the kingship was established, neutralizing all input from village chiefs. A &quot;cult of kingship&quot; was established. A captive slave would be sacrificed annually to honor the royal ancestors. During the 1720s, the slave-trading states of [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]] and Allada were taken, giving Dahomey direct access to the slave coast and trade with Europeans. King [[Agadja]] (1708–1740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on firearms were too great. In 1730, under king Agaja, Dahomey was conquered by the [[Oyo Empire]], and Dahomey had to pay tribute. Taxes on slaves were mostly paid in cowrie shells. During the 19th century, palm oil was the main trading commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 191, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; France conquered Dahomey during the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] (1892–1894) and established a colonial government there. Most of the troops who fought against Dahomey were native Africans.=====Yoruba====={{See|List of rulers of the Yoruba state of Oyo}}[[Image:WestAfrica1625.png|right|thumb|250px|Oyo Empire and surrounding states, c. 1625.]]Traditionally, the [[Yoruba people]] viewed themselves as the inhabitants of a united empire, in contrast to the situation today, in which &quot;Yoruba&quot; is the cultural-linguistic designation for speakers of a language in the [[Niger–Congo]] family. The name comes from a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word to refer to the [[Oyo Empire]]. The first Yoruba state was [[Ife|Ile-Ife]], said to have been founded around 1000 CE by a supernatural figure, the first ''oni'' [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different city-states of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba ''obas'', or kings. Yoruba city-states were usually governed by an ''oba'' and a ''iwarefa'', a council of chiefs who advised the ''oba.'' By the 18th century, the Yoruba city-states formed a loose confederation, with the ''Oni'' of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual city-states became more powerful with their ''obas'' assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the ''Oni'' of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the city-states.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 131&amp;ndash;132.&lt;/ref&gt;The Oyo Empire rose in the 16th century. The Oyo state had been conquered in 1550 by the kingdom of [[Nupe people|Nupe]], which was in possession of cavalry, an important tactical advantage. The ''alafin'' (king) of Oyo was sent into exile. After returning, ''Alafin'' [[Orompoto]] (c. 1560&amp;ndash;1580) built up an army based on heavily armed cavalry and long-service troops. This made them invincible in combat on the northern grasslands and in the thinly wooded forests. By the end of the 16th century, Oyo had added the western region of the Niger to the hills of Togo, the Yoruba of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], Dahomey, and the Fon nation.A governing council served the empire, with clear executive divisions.  Each acquired region was assigned a local administrator. Families served in king-making capacities. Oyo, as a northern Yoruba kingdom, served as middle-man in the north-south trade and connecting the eastern forest of [[Guinea]] with the western and central [[sahel|Sudan]], the Sahara, and North Africa. The Yoruba manufactured cloth, ironware, and pottery, which were exchanged for salt, leather, and most importantly horses from the Sudan to maintain the cavalry. Oyo remained strong for two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), pp. 173&amp;ndash;174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; It became a protectorate of [[Great Britain]] in 1888, before further fragmenting into warring factions.  The Oyo state ceased to exist as any sort of power in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Stride, G.T. &amp; C. Ifeka (1971). ''Peoples and Empires of West Africa: West Africa in History 1000&amp;ndash;1800''.

By the mid 15th century, the [[Benin Empire]] was engaged in political expansion and consolidation. Under ''Oba'' (king) [[Ewuare]] (c. 1450&amp;ndash;1480 CE), the state was organized for conquest. He solidified central authority and initiated 30 years of war with his neighbors. At his death, the Benin Empire extended to Dahomey in the west, to the [[Niger Delta]] in the east, along the west African coast, and to the Yoruba towns in the north.Ewuare's grandson ''Oba'' [[Esigie]] (1504–1550) eroded the power of the ''uzama'' (state council) and increase contact and trade with Europeans, especially with the Portuguese who provided a new source of copper for court art.The ''oba'' ruled with the advice from the ''uzama'', a council consisting of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power. The queen mother who produced the future ''oba'' wielded immense influence.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 134&amp;ndash;135.&lt;/ref&gt;Benin's expansion ended around the 16th century, and it ceased being a major exporter of slaves. By the 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese, who resold it to other African societies on the coast. In 1897, the British sacked the city.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 188&amp;ndash;189.&lt;/ref&gt;=====Niger Delta and Igbo====={{See|List of rulers of Nri}}{{Igbo land labelled map}}The [[Niger Delta]] comprised numerous city-states with numerous forms of government. These city-states were protected by the waterways and thick vegetation of the delta. The region was transformed by trade in the 17th century CE. The delta's city-states were comparable to those of the [[Swahili people]] in East Africa. Some, like [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Kalabari Kingdom|Kalabari]], and [[Kingdom of Warri|Warri]], had kings. Others, like [[Brass, Nigeria|Brass]], were republics with small senates, and those at [[Cross River State|Cross River]] and [[Calabar|Old Calabar]] were ruled by merchants of the ''ekpe'' society. The ''ekpe'' society regulated trade and made rules for members known as house systems. Some of these houses, like the Pepples of Bonny, were well-known in the Americas and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 136&amp;ndash;137.&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lived east of the delta (but with the [[Anioma]] on the west of the Niger River). The [[Kingdom of Nri]] rose in the 9th century CE, with the ''Eze'' Nri being its leader. The kingdom expanded towards the Kingdom of Benin and to the [[Igala Kingdom]] between 1100 and 1400. It was a political entity composed of villages, and each village was autonomous and independent with its own territory and name, each recognized by its neighbors. Villages were democratic with all males and sometimes females a part of the decision-making process. Graves at [[Igbo-Ukwu]] (800 CE) contained brass artifacts of local manufacture and glass beads from Egypt or India, indicative of extraregional trade.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Phyllis M. and O'Meara, Patrick(1995). p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;===Central Africa==={{See|Early Congolese history|Congo Free State|History of the Republic of the Congo}}Around 1000 BCE, Bantu migrants had reached the Great Lakes of East Africa. Halfway through the first millennium BCE, the Bantu had also settled as far south as what is now [[Angola]].====Luba Empire====[[File:Realluba.JPG|thumb|250px|Central African states]][[File:Luba pottery-1908.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Luba pottery]]{{Main|Luba Empire}}Sometime between 1300 to 1400 CE, [[Kongolo Mwamba]] (Nkongolo) from the Balopwe clan unified the various [[Luba people]]s, near [[Lake Kisale]]. He founded the Kongolo Dynasty, which was later ousted by [[Kalala Ilunga]]. Kalala expanded the kingdom west of Lake Kisale. A new centralized political system of spiritual kings (''balopwe'') with a court council of head governors and sub-heads all the way to village heads. The ''balopwe'' was the direct communicator with the ancestral spirits and chosen by them. Conquered states were integrated into the system and represented in the court, with their titles. The authority of the ''balopwe'' resided in his spiritual power rather than his military authority. The army was relatively small. The Luba was able to control regional trade and collect tribute for redistribution. Numerous offshoot states were formed with founders claiming descent from the Luba. The Luba political system spread throughout [[Central Africa]], southern [[Uganda]], Rwanda, Burundi, [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the western Congo. Two major major empires claiming Luba descent were the [[Lunda Empire]] and [[Maravi|Maravi Empire]]. The [[Bemba people]] of northern Zambia were descended from Luba migrants who arrived in Zambia during the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 138, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), p. 159, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;====Lunda Empire===={{Main|Lunda Empire}}{{See|List of Rulers of the Lunda Empire}}[[File:Lunda houses-1854.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lunda town and dwelling]]In the 1450s, a [[Luba Empire|Luba]] from the royal family [[Ilunga Tshibinda]] married [[Lunda people|Lunda]] queen Rweej and united all Lunda peoples. Their son ''mulopwe'' Luseeng expanded the kingdom. His son Naweej expanded the empire further and is known as the first Lunda emperor, with the title ''mwato yamvo'' (''mwaant yaav'' , ''mwant yav''), the Lord of Vipers. The Luba political system was retained, and conquered peoples were integrated into the system. The ''mwato yamvo'' assigned a ''cilool'' or ''kilolo'' (royal adviser) and tax collector to each state conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot;&gt;Davidson (1991), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;Numerous states claimed descent from the Lunda. The [[Imbangala]] of inland Angola claimed descent from a founder, Kinguri, brother of Queen Rweej, who could not tolerate the rule of ''mulopwe'' Tshibunda. ''Kinguri'' became the title of kings of states founded by Queen Rweej's brother. The [[Luena people|Luena]] (Lwena) and [[Lozi people|Lozi]] (Luyani) in Zambia also claim descent from Kinguri. During the 17th century, a Lunda chief and warrior called [[Mwata Kazembe]] set up an [[Eastern Lunda]] kingdom in the valley of the [[Luapula River]]. The Lunda's western expansion also saw claims of descent by the [[Yaka people|Yaka]] and the [[Pende people|Pende]]. The Lunda linked middle Africa with the western coast trade. The kingdom of Lunda came to an end in the 19th century when it was invaded by the [[Chokwe]], who were armed with guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 139, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;====Maravi (Malawi)===={{See|List of rulers of Maravi}}[[File:Mavari Kingdom c. 1650s.svg|thumb|250px|right|Maravi Kingdom]]The [[Maravi]] claimed descent from Karonga (''kalonga''), who took that title as king. The Maravi connected middle Africa to the east coastal trade, with [[Swahili people|Swahili]] [[Kilwa Empire|Kilwa]]. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between  [[Lake Malawi]] and the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]]. The ''karonga'' was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the [[Shona people|Shona]] in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, he turned on the Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcome back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura. By the 18th century, it had broken into its previous polities.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), pp. 164&amp;ndash;165.&lt;/ref&gt;====Kongo Empire===={{See|List of rulers of Kongo}}[[File:KingdomKongo1711.png|thumb|250px|right|Kongo in 1711]]By the 15th century CE, the farming [[Kongo people|Bakongo people]] (''ba'' being the plural prefix) were unified as the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] under a ruler called the ''[[manikongo]]'', residing in the fertile [[Pool Malebo]] area on the lower [[Congo River]]. The capital was [[M'banza-Kongo]]. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the ''manikongo''.  Later, [[maize]] (corn) and [[cassava]] (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the Portuguese at their ports at [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]]. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing [[millet]] as a main staple.By the 16th century, the ''manikongo'' held authority from the Atlantic in the west to the [[Kwango River]] in the east. Each territory was assigned a ''mani-mpembe'' (provincial governor) by the ''manikongo''. In 1506, [[Afonso I of Kongo|Afonso I]] (1506–1542), a Christian, took over the throne. Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the [[Jaga (people)|Jaga]] invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the ''manikongo'' into exile. In 1574, Manikongo [[Álvaro I of Kongo|Álvaro I]] was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo [[António I of Kongo|António I]] (1661–1665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]]. The empire dissolved into petty polities, fighting among each other for war captives to sell into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 185&amp;ndash;188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 196&amp;ndash;198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), pp. 156&amp;ndash;157&lt;/ref&gt;Kongo gained captives from the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]] in wars of conquest. Ndongo was ruled by the ''ngola''. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with [[São Tomé]] being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the [[Mbundu people|Mbundu]]. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at [[Kingdom of Matamba|Matamba]], affiliated with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Nzinga]], who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives. The [[Imbangala]] formed the slave-raiding state of [[Kasanje Kingdom|Kasanje]], a major source of slaves during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 198, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;===Southern Africa==={{See|Ancient History of South Africa|History of South Africa|History of Namibia|History of Botswana}}Settlements of [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] peoples who were iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen were present south of the [[Limpopo River]] by the 4th or 5th century CE, displacing and absorbing the original [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan speakers]]. They slowly moved south, and the earliest ironworks in modern-day [[KwaZulu-Natal|KwaZulu-Natal Province]] are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoi-San people, reaching the [[Great Fish River]] in today's [[Eastern Cape|Eastern Cape Province]].====Great Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe===={{See|List of rulers of Mutapa}}[[File:Great zimbabwe 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Great Zimbabwe]]]]The [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] was the first state in [[Southern Africa]], with its capital at Mapungubwe. The state arose in the 12th century CE. Its wealth came from controlling the trade in ivory from the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo Valley]], copper from the mountains of northern [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], and gold from the [[Zimbabwe]] Plateau between the Limpopo and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers, with the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants at [[Chibuene]]. By the mid 13th century, Mapungubwe was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Ehret, Christopher (2002). p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;After the decline of  Mapungubwe, [[Great Zimbabwe]] rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. ''Zimbabwe'' means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and was the center of an empire, consolidating lesser [[Shona people|Shona]] polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili [[Kilwa Empire|Kilwa]] and [[Sofala]]. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore  Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on the decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town [[Ingombe Ilede]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehret (2002), pp. 252-254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153&quot;&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 147&amp;ndash;153.&lt;/ref&gt;A new chapter of Shona history ensued. Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga,, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through [[Mozambique]] to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire ''Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah'' or ''mwanamutapa'' (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. ''Monomotapa'' was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: [[Torwa dynasty|Torwa]] in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the ''mwanamutapa'' line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the [[Kingdom of Butua]] with its capital at [[Khami]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254&quot;&gt;Davidson (1991), pp. 252-254.&lt;/ref&gt;The Mutapa Empire continued in the north under the ''mwanamutapa'' line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet ''mwanamutapa'' named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese. The Portuguese were successful in destroying the ''mwanamutapa'' system of government and undermining trade. By 1667, Mutapa was in decay. Chiefs would not allow digging for gold because of fear of Portuguese theft, and the population declined.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), pp. 252&amp;ndash;154.&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Kingdom of Butua]] was ruled by a ''changamire'', a title derived from the founder, Changa. Later it became the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Portuguese tried to gain a foothold but were thrown out of the region in 1693, by Changamire Dombo. The 17th century was a period of peace and prosperity. The Rozwi Empire fell into ruins in the 1830s from invading [[Nguni people|Nguni]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254&quot;/&gt;====Namibia====[[File:Realnam.JPG|thumb|250px|Herero and Nama Territories]]By 1500 CE, most of southern Africa had established states. In northwestern [[Namibia]], the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] engaged in farming and the [[Herero people|Herero]] engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the Mbanderu, expanded to [[Ghanzi]] in northwestern [[Botswana]]. The [[Nama people|Nama]], a [[Khoisan languages|Khoi-speaking]], sheep-raising group, moved northward and came into contact with the Herero; this would set the stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding [[Lozi people|Lozi]] states pushed the [[Mbukushu]], [[Kuhane language|Subiya]], and Yei to Botei, [[Kavango Region|Okavango]], and [[Chobe District|Chobe]] in northern Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;====South Africa and Botswana=========Sotho–Tswana=====[[image:Realzulu.JPG|thumb|250px|South African ethnic groups]]The development of [[Sotho–Tswana peoples|Sotho–Tswana]] states based on the [[highveld]], south of the [[Limpopo River]], began around 1000 CE. The chief's power rested on cattle and his connection to the ancestor. This can be seen in the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] settlements with stone foundations and stone walls, north of the highveld and south of the [[Vaal River]]. Northwest of the Vaal River developed early [[Tswana people|Tswana]] states centered around towns of thousands of people. When disagreements or rivalry arose, different groups moved to form their own states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155&quot;&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 153&amp;ndash;155.&lt;/ref&gt;=====Nguni and Zulu=====Southeast of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains lived [[Nguni languages|Nguni-speaking]] peoples ([[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Swazi people|Swazi]], and [[Ndebele]]). They too engaged in state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. They were metalworkers, cultivators of millet, and cattle herders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155&quot;/&gt;=====Khoisan and Afrikaaner=====[[Image:SouthAfrica1885.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Political map of Southern Africa in 1885]]The [[Khoisan]] lived in the southwestern [[Cape Province]], where winter rainfall is plentiful. Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by [[Bantu peoples]], such as the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]], but the [[Bantu expansion]] stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some [[Bantu languages]] have incorporated the click characteristic of the [[Khoisan languages]]. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155&quot;/&gt;By the 16th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a replenishing station at [[Table Bay]] for restocking water and purchasing meat from the [[Khoikhoi]]. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch established a permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew fresh fruit and vegetables and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided to increase the number of farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher ''[[boer]]s'' (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first [[Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars|Khoikhoi-Dutch war]] in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a &quot;right of conquest&quot; by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673–1677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 210-213.&lt;/ref&gt;By the 18th century, the cape colony had grown, with slaves coming from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Indonesia]]. The settlement also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and guerrilla warfare slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice pastoralism were known as ''[[trekboer]]s''. A common source of ''trekboer'' labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 213, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;==19th century=====Southern Africa===By the 1850s, British and German missionaries and traders had penetrated Namibia. Herero and Nama competed for guns and ammunition, providing cattle, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The Germans were more firmly established than the British in the region. By 1884, the Germans declared the coastal region from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Cunene River|Kunene River]] a German protectorate. They pursued an aggressive policy of land expansion for white settlements. They exploited rivalry between the Nama and Herero.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327-329, 340-342.&lt;/ref&gt;The Herero entered into an alliance with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and Mbanderu rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, [[rinderpest]] crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and even trying to export Herero labor to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327&lt;/ref&gt;In 1904,  the Herero rebelled. German General [[Lothar von Trotha]] implemented an [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|extermination policy]] at the [[Battle of Waterberg]], which drove the Herero west of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. At the end of 1905, only 16,000 Herero were alive, out of a previous population of 80,000. Nama resistance was crushed in 1907. All Nama and Herero cattle and land were confiscated from the very diminished population, with remaining Nama and Herero assuming a subordinate position. Labor had to be imported from among the Ovambo.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327.&lt;/ref&gt;===Zululand===A moment of great disorder in southern Africa was the ''[[Mfecane]]'', &quot;the crushing.&quot; It was started by the northern Nguni kingdoms of [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]], [[Ndwandwe]], and Swaziland over scarce resource and famine. When [[Dingiswayo]] of Mthethwa died, [[Shaka]] of the Zulu people took over. He established the [[Zulu Kingdom]], asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the Swazi north. The scattering Ndwandwe and Swazi caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid as far south as the [[Tugela River|Tugela]] and [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]] rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with ''indunas'', responsible to him. He introduced a centralized, dedicated, and disciplined military force not seen in  the region, with a new weapon in the short stabbing-spear.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 256, 257, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half brother [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]], who lacked the military genius and leadership skills of Shaka. [[Voortrekkers]] tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In the early months they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the [[Blood River|Ncome River]] and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers dared not settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother [[Mpande]] took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 the Zulu Kingdom was invaded by Britain in a quest to control all of [[South Africa]]. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] but was defeated at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 256, 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), pp. 274-275.&lt;/ref&gt;One of the major states to emerge from the [[Mfecane]] was the [[Lesotho|Sotho Kingdom]] founded at [[Thaba Bosiu]] by [[Moshoeshoe I]] around 1821 to 1822. It was a confederation different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the [[Cape Province|Cape]]. [[Orange Free State]] slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of [[Basutoland]].&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 261&amp;ndash;262, 271.&lt;/ref&gt;===Voortrekkers===By the 19th century, most Khoikhoi territory was under Boer control. The Khoikhoi had lost economic and political independence and had been absorbed into Boer society. The Boers spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language or dialect derived from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and no longer called themselves Boers but [[Afrikaner]]. Some Khoikhoi were used as commandos in raids against other Khoikhoi and later Xhosa. A mixed Khoi, slave, and European population called the [[Cape Coloureds]], who were outcasts within colonial society, also arose. Khoikhoi who lived far on the frontier included the Kora, [[Oorlams creole|Oorlams]], and [[Griqua people|Griqua]]. In 1795, the British took over the cape colony from the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 215&amp;ndash;216.&lt;/ref&gt;In the 1830s, Boers embarked on a journey of expansion, east of the [[Great Fish River]] into the Zuurveld. They were referred to as ''[[Voortrekkers]]''. They founded republics of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and [[Orange Free State]], mostly in areas of sparse population that had been diminished by the ''[[Mfecane|Mfecane/Difaqane]]''. Unlike the Khoisan, the Bantu states were not conquered by the Afrikaners, because of population density and greater unity. Additionally, they began to arm themselves with guns acquired through trade at the cape. In some cases, as in the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa/Boer Wars]], Boers were removed from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] lands. It required a dedicated imperial military force to subdue the Bantu-speaking states. In 1901, the Boer republics were defeated by Britain in the [[Second Boer War]]. The defeat however consummated many Afrikaners' ambition: South Africa would be under white rule. The British placed all power—legislative, executive, administrative—in English and Afrikaner hands.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1991), pp. 274&amp;ndash;275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), pp. 268&amp;ndash;271.&lt;/ref&gt;===European trade, exploration and conquest==={{See|European exploration of Africa|African slave trade|Colonization of Africa}}[[Image:Maxim machine gun Megapixie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1895 .303 tripod mounted Maxim machine gun]]Between 1878 and 1898, European states partitioned and conquered most of Africa. For 400 years, European nations had mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that did, like the Portuguese, often met defeats and had to retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of [[repeating rifle]]s, which were easier and quicker to load than [[musket]]s. [[Artillery]] was being used increasingly. In 1885, [[Hiram S. Maxim]] developed the [[maxim gun]], the model of the modern-day [[machine gun]]. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 268-269.&lt;/ref&gt;African germs took numerous European lives and deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], and [[leprosy]] made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans. The deadliest disease was [[malaria]], endemic throughout tropical Africa. In 1854, the discovery of [[quinine]] and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;Strong motives for conquest of Africa were at play. Raw materials were needed for European factories. Europe in the early part of the 19th century was undergoing its [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nationalist rivalries and prestige were at play. Acquiring African colonies would show rivals that a nation was powerful and significant. These factors culminated in the [[Scramble for Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Davidlivingstone cropped.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[David Livingstone]], early explorer of the interior of Africa.]]Knowledge of Africa increased. Numerous European explorers began to explore the continent. [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] traversed the [[Niger River]]. [[James Bruce]] travelled through [[Ethiopia]] and located the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. [[Richard Francis Burton]] was the first European at [[Lake Tanganyika]]. [[Samuel White Baker]] explored the Upper Nile. [[John Hanning Speke]] located a source of the [[Nile]] at [[Lake Victoria]]. Other significant European explorers included [[Heinrich Barth]], [[Henry Morton Stanley]], [[António Silva Porto|Silva Porto]], [[Alexandre de Serpa Pinto]], [[Rene Caille]], [[Gerhard Rolfs]], [[Gustav Nachtigal]], [[George Schweinfurth]], and [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]]. The most famous of the explorers was [[David Livingstone]], who explored southern Africa and traversed the continent from the Atlantic at [[Luanda]] to the Indian Ocean at [[Quelimane]]. European explorers made use of African guides and servants, and established long-distance trading routes were used.&lt;ref&gt;Shillington (2005), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2007 pp. 254-257&quot;&gt;Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 254-257.&lt;/ref&gt;Missionaries attempting to spread Christianity also increased European knowledge of Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2007 pp. 254-257&quot;/&gt;Between 1884 and 1885, European nations met at the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin West Africa Conference]] to discuss the partitioning of Africa. It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation. In a series of treaties in 1890–1891, colonial boundaries were completely drawn. All of sub saharan Africa was claimed by European powers, except for Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]].The European powers set up a variety of different administrations in Africa, reflecting different ambitions and degrees of power. In some areas, such as parts of British West Africa, colonial control was tenuous and intended for simple economic extraction, strategic power, or as part of a long term development plan. In other areas, Europeans were encouraged to settle, creating settler states in which a European minority dominated. Settlers only came to a few colonies in sufficient numbers to have a strong impact. British settler colonies included [[British East Africa]] (now Kenya), [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], ([[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively), and [[South Africa]], which already had a significant population of European settlers, the Boers.France planned to settle Algeria and eventually incorporate it into the French state on an equal basis with the European provinces. Algeria's proximity across the Mediterranean allowed plans of this scale.In most areas colonial administrations did not have the manpower or resources to fully administer the territory and had to rely on local power structures to help them. Various factions and groups within the societies exploited this European requirement for their own purposes, attempting to gain positions of power within their own communities by cooperating with Europeans. One aspect of this struggle included what [[Terence Ranger]] has termed the &quot;invention of tradition.&quot; In order to legitimize their own claims to power in the eyes of both the colonial administrators and their own people, native elites would essentially manufacture &quot;traditional&quot; claims to power, or ceremonies. As a result, many societies were thrown into disarray by the new order.====European colonial territories===='''Belgium'''[[Image:Colonial Africa 1914 map.png|thumb|right|400px|Areas controlled by European colonial powers on the African continent in 1914]]*[[Congo Free State]] and [[Belgian Congo]] (today's [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]])*[[Ruanda-Urundi]] (comprising modern [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]], between 1916 and 1960)'''France'''{||-| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[French West Africa]]:**[[Mauritania]]**[[Senegal]]**[[French Sudan]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Mali]])**[[French Guinea]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Guinea]])**[[Côte d'Ivoire]]**[[Colony of Niger|Niger]]**[[French Upper Volta]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Burkina Faso]])**[[French Dahomey]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Benin]])| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[French Equatorial Africa]]:**[[Gabon]]**[[Middle Congo]]&lt;br /&gt;(now the [[Republic of the Congo]])**[[Oubangi-Chari]]&lt;br /&gt;(now the [[Central African Republic]])**[[Colonial Chad|Chad]]| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[French Algeria]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Algeria]])*[[French occupation of Tunisia|Tunisia]]*[[French Morocco]]*[[French Somaliland]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Djibouti]])*[[Madagascar]]*[[Comoros]]|}'''Germany'''*[[German Kamerun]] (now [[Cameroon]] and part of [[Nigeria]])*[[German East Africa]] (now [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]] and most of [[Tanzania]])*[[German South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]])*[[German Togoland]] (now [[Togo]] and eastern part of [[Ghana]])'''Italy'''[[Italian North Africa]] (now [[Libya]])*[[Eritrea]]*[[Italian Somaliland]] (now part of [[Somalia]])'''Portugal'''{||-| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[Portuguese West Africa]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Angola]])**Mainland [[Angola]]**[[Portuguese Congo]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Cabinda Province]] of [[Angola]])*[[Portuguese East Africa]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Mozambique]])*[[Portuguese Guinea]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Guinea-Bissau]])| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[Cape Verde Islands]]*[[São Tomé e Príncipe]]**[[São Tomé Island]]**[[Príncipe Island]]**[[Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Ouidah]], in [[Benin]])|}'''Spain'''{||-| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[Spanish Sahara]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Western Sahara]])**[[Río de Oro]]**[[Saguia el-Hamra]]| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[Spanish Morocco]]**[[Tarfaya Strip]]**[[Ifni]]| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[Spanish Guinea]]&lt;br /&gt;(now [[Equatorial Guinea]])**[[Bioko|Fernando Po]]**[[Río Muni]]**[[Annobon]]|}'''United Kingdom'''{||-| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[Egypt]]*[[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] (now [[Sudan]])*[[British Somaliland]] (now part of [[Somalia]])*[[British East Africa]]:**[[Kenya]]**[[Uganda Protectorate]] (now [[Uganda]])**[[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] (1919–1961, now part of [[Tanzania]])*[[Zanzibar]] (now part of [[Tanzania]])| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[Bechuanaland]] (now [[Botswana]])*[[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]])*[[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]])*[[Union of South Africa|British South Africa]] (now [[South Africa]])**[[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] (now part of [[South Africa]])**[[Cape Colony]] (now part of South Africa)**[[Colony of Natal]] (now part of South Africa)**[[Orange Free State]] (now part of South Africa)| valign=&quot;top&quot; |*[[The Gambia]]*[[Sierra Leone]]*[[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]]*[[Cameroons]] (now parts of [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]])*[[British Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]])*[[Nyasaland]] (now [[Malawi]])*[[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]])*[[Swaziland]]|}'''Independent states'''*[[Liberia]], founded by the [[American Colonization Society]] of the [[United States]] in 1821; declared independence in 1847*[[Ethiopian Empire]] (Abyssinia) had its borders re-drawn with [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[French Somaliland]] (modern [[Djibouti]]), briefly occupied by [[Italy]] from 1936 to 1941 during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]];*[[Sudan]], independent under [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdi]] rule between 1885 and 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Phyllis M. and O'Meara, Patrick (1995). p. 135&amp;ndash;138.&lt;/ref&gt;==20th century ==During this era a sense of local patriotism or nationalism took deeper root among African intellectuals and politicians. Some of the inspiration for this movement came from the First World War in which European countries had relied on colonial troops for their own defense. Many in Africa realized their own strength with regard to the colonizer for the first time. At the same time, some of the mystique of the &quot;invincible&quot; European was shattered by the barbarities of the war. However, in most areas European control remained relatively strong during this period.After World War I the formerly German colonies in Africa were taken over by France, Belgium, and the United Kingdom.[[Italy]], under the government of [[Benito Mussolini]], invaded [[Ethiopia]], the last independent African nation, in 1935 and occupied the country until 1941.===Second half of 20th century: decolonization==={{see|Historical African place names}}[[Image:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dates of independence of African countries.]]The [[decolonization of Africa]] started with [[Libya]] in 1951. (Although Liberia, South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia were already independent.) Many countries followed in the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with independence of a large part of [[French West Africa]]. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers ([[Portugal]] in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a decade or more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were [[Guinea-Bissau]] (1974), [[Mozambique]] (1975) and [[Angola]] (1975) from Portugal; [[Djibouti]] from [[France]] in 1977; [[Zimbabwe]] from [[United Kingdom]] in 1980; and [[Namibia]] from [[South Africa]] in 1990. [[Eritrea]] later split off from [[Ethiopia]] in 1993.Because many cities were founded, enlarged and renamed by the Europeans, after independence many place names were renamed.====East Africa===={{Main|East Africa}}{{unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}The [[Mau Mau]] Rebellion took place in [[Kenya]] from 1952 until 1956 but was put down by British and local forces. A State of Emergency remained in place until 1960. Kenya became independent in 1963, and [[Jomo Kenyatta]] served as its first president.The early 1990s also signaled the start of major clashes between the [[Hutu]]s and the [[Tutsi]]s in [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]. In 1994 this culminated in the [[Rwandan Genocide]], a conflict in which over 800,000 people were murdered.====North Africa===={{Main|North Africa}}[[Moroccan]] nationalism developed during the 1930s; the [[Istiqal Party]] was formed, pushing for independence. In 1953 sultan [[Muhammad V]] called for independence. On March 2, 1956, Morocco became independent of France. Spain relinquished the territories of [[Ceuta]], [[Tangiers]], and [[Melilla]]. Muhammad V became ruler of independent Morocco.In 1954, [[Algeria]] formed the National Liberation Front (FLN) as it split from France. The French responded brutally but negotiated independence in 1962. [[Muhammad Ahmed Ben Bella]] was elected president. All French citizens left the country, crippling the economy.In 1934, the &quot;Neo-Destour&quot; (New Constitution) party was founded by [[Habib Bourguiba]] pushing for independence in [[Tunisia]]. Tunisia became independent in 1955. Its ''bey'' was disposed and [[Habib Bourguiba]] elected.&lt;ref&gt;Lye, Keith(2002). pp. 97, 264.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1954, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] deposed the monarchy of Egypt and came to power. [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] led a coup in Libya in 1969 and has remained in power.Egypt was involved in several wars against [[Israel]] and was allied with other [[Arab]] countries. The first was right after the state of Israel was founded, in 1948. Egypt went to war again in 1967 and lost the [[Sinai Peninsula]] to Israel. They went to war yet again in 1973. In 1979, [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Menachem Begin]] signed the [[Camp David Accords]], which gave back the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for the recognition of Israel. The accords are still in effect today. In 1981, Sadat was [[assassination|assassinated]] by an [[Islamist]] for signing the accords.====Southern Africa===={{Main|Southern Africa}}{{unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}In 1948 the [[History of South Africa in the Apartheid Era|apartheid]] laws were started in [[South Africa]] by the dominant  National Party. These were largely a continuation of existing policies; the difference was the policy of &quot;separate development.&quot; Where previous policies had only been disparate efforts to economically exploit the African majority, apartheid represented an entire philosophy of separate racial goals, leading to both the divisive laws of 'petty apartheid,' and the grander scheme of African homelands.In 1994, the South African government abolished apartheid. South Africans elected [[Nelson Mandela]] of the [[African National Congress]] in the country's first multiracial presidential election.====West Africa===={{Main|History of West Africa}}{{unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}Following [[World War II]], nationalist movements arose across West Africa, most notably in [[Ghana]] under [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. In 1957, Ghana became the first sub-Saharan colony to achieve its independence, followed the next year by France's colonies; by 1974, West Africa's nations were entirely autonomous. Since independence, many West African nations have been plagued by [[political corruption|corruption]] and instability, with notable civil wars in [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]], and a succession of military coups in Ghana and [[Burkina Faso]]. Many states have failed to develop their economies despite enviable natural resources, and political instability is often accompanied by undemocratic government.==See also=={{portal box|Africa|History}}*[[List of kingdoms in pre-colonial Africa]]*[[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa]]==Notes=={{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}==References==*Collins, Robert O.; Burns, James M.
