The war was a result of the physical [[division of Korea]] by an agreement of the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the conclusion of the [[Pacific War]] at the end of [[World War II]].The [[Korean peninsula]] was [[Korea under Japanese rule|ruled by Japan]] from 1910 until the end of World War II.

The 38th Parallel increasingly became a political border between the two Koreas. Although reunification negotiations continued in the months preceding the war, tension intensified.  Cross-border skirmishes and raids at the 38th Parallel persisted. The situation escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devine 2007 819-821&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Devine |first= Robert A. |coauthors= Breen, TH; Frederickson, George M; Williams, R Hal; Gross, Adriela J; Brands, HW | title= America Past and Present | edition = 8th | volume = II: Since 1865 | publisher= [[Pearson Education|Pearson Longman]] | year = 2007 | pages = 819–21 | isbn= 0-321-44661-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first significant armed conflict of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name = &quot;TruceTent&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hermes, Jr. |first =Walter |title =Truce Tent and Fighting Front |publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] |origyear=1966| year = 2002 |pages =2, 6–9 |url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/korea/truce/fm.htm | series = United States Army in the Korean War}}&lt;/ref&gt;The United Nations, particularly the [[United States]], came to the aid of South Korea in repelling the invasion, but within two months the defenders were pushed back to the [[Pusan perimeter]], a small area in the south of the country, before the North Koreans were stopped. A rapid UN counter-offensive then drove the North Koreans past the 38th Parallel and almost to the [[Yalu River]], and the People's Republic of China (PRC) entered the war on the side of the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devine 2007 819-821&quot;/&gt;  The Chinese launched a counter-offensive that pushed the United Nations forces back across the 38th Parallel. The Soviet Union materially aided the North Korean and Chinese armies. In 1953, the war ceased with an armistice that restored the border between the Koreas near the 38th Parallel and created the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ), a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} wide buffer zone between the two Koreas. Minor outbreaks of fighting continue to the present day.With both North and South Korea sponsored by external powers, the Korean War was a [[proxy war]].  From a [[military science]] perspective, it combined strategies and tactics of [[World War I]] and World War II: it began with a mobile campaign of swift [[infantry]] attacks followed by air [[tactical bombing|bombing]] raids, but became a static [[trench warfare|trench]] war by July 1951.==Background=====Etymology===In the United States, the war was initially described by President [[Harry S.

In 1938, the Colonial Government established labor conscription.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}In China, the [[National Revolutionary Army]] and the Communist [[People's Liberation Army]] helped organize refugee Korean patriots and independence fighters against the Japanese military, which had also occupied parts of China.

Before the invasion, Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by Secretary of State Acheson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Major Powers and Korea |author= Kim |location=page 30 |publisher= Silver Spring, MD |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than East Asia. At the same time, the Administration was worried that a war in Korea could quickly widen into another world war should the Chinese or Soviets decide to get involved as well.One facet of the changing attitude toward Korea and whether to get involved was Japan. Especially after the fall of China to the Communists, &quot;…Japan itself increasingly appeared as the major East Asian prize to be protected&quot;.  US East Asian experts saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region. While there was no United States policy that dealt with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan pushed South Korea to the fore.  &quot;The recognition that the security of Japan required a non-hostile Korea led directly to President Truman’s decision to intervene…  The essential point… is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of US policy toward Japan.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;Kim&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title= Major Powers and Korea | author= Kim | page = 46 | location = Silver Spring, MD |year = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States wanted to shore up Japan to make it a viable counterweight against the Soviet Union and China, and Korea was seen as integral to that end.The other important part of committing to intervention lay in speculation about Soviet action in the event that the United States intervene.  The Truman administration was fretful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the US committed in Korea. At the same time, &quot;[t]here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from [the conflict]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Korea: the Limited War |author=Rees |location=page 22 |publisher= St Martin's |year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Truman’s mind, this aggression, if left unchecked, would start a chain reaction that would destroy the United Nations and give the go ahead to further Communist aggression elsewhere.  Korea was where a stand had to be made, the difficult part was how.  The UN Security council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans and the US immediately began using air and naval forces in the area to that end.  The Administration still refrained from committing on the ground because some advisors believed the North Koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Korea: the Limited War |author=Rees | page = 23 | publisher= St Martin's | year= 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, it was still uncertain if this was a clever ploy by the Soviet Union to catch the US unawares or just a test of US resolve. The decision to commit ground troops and to intervene eventually became viable when a communiqué was received on June 27 from the Soviet Union that alluded it would not move against US forces in Korea. &quot;This opened the way for the sending of American ground forces, for it now seemed less likely that a general war—with Korea as a preliminary diversion—was imminent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Korea: the Limited War | author= Rees | page = 26 |publisher= St Martin's |year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Soviet Union’s tacit agreement that this would not cause an escalation, the United States now could intervene with confidence that other commitments would not be jeopardized.====United Nations Security Council Resolutions====On 25 June 1950, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of the Republic of Korea, with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 82]]. The USSR, a [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto-wielding power]], had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950, protesting that the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), not the People's Republic of China, [[China and the United Nations|held a permanent seat]] in the UN Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Malkasian |first =Carter |title= The Korean War: Essential Histories |publisher= Osprey Publishing |year =2001 |page =16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After debating the matter, the Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 83|Resolution 83]] recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea. On 27 June [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] ordered US air and sea forces to help the South Korean régime. On 4 July the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister accused the US of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1950-gromyko-korea.html |title=Statement by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, July 4, 1950 |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;The USSR challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons. The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from US Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the Korean conflict was beyond UN Charter scope, because the initial north–south border fighting was classed as a civil war. The Soviet representative boycotted the UN to prevent Security Council action, and to challenge the legitimacy of the UN action; legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of the five permanent members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/793412 Leo Gross, &quot;Voting in the Security Council: Abstention from Voting and Absence from Meetings&quot;, ''The Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 60, No. 2 (Feb., 1951), pp. 209–57].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/443348 F.

Their forces included 274 [[T-34|T-34-85]] tanks, some 150 [[Yakovlev|Yak]] fighters, 110 attack bombers, 200 artillery pieces, 78 Yak trainers, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appleman&quot; /&gt; In addition to the invasion force, the North Korean KPA had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appleman&quot; /&gt; Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North Korean and South Korean navies fought in the war as sea-borne artillery for their in-country armies.In contrast, the ROK Army defenders were vastly unprepared, and the political establishment in the south, while well aware of the threat to the north, were unable to convince American administrators of the reality of the threat. In ''South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu'' (1961), R.E. Appleman reports the ROK forces' low combat readiness as of 25 June 1950. The ROK Army had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the US military, but requests were denied), and a 22–piece air force comprising 12 [[Liaison aircraft|liaison-type]] and 10 [[T-6 Texan|AT6]] advanced-trainer airplanes. There were no large foreign military garrisons in Korea at invasion time, but there were large US garrisons and air forces in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appleman&quot; /&gt;Within days of the invasion, masses of ROK Army soldiers—of dubious loyalty to the Syngman Rhee régime—were either retreating southwards or were [[Defection|defecting]] en masse to the northern side, the KPA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokesbury1990&quot;/&gt;{{rp|23}}===United Nations response (July – August 1950)===[[File:KumRiver Howitzer.jpg|thumb|alt=A group of soldiers readying a large gun in some brush.|A US howitzer position near the Kum River, July 15.]][[File:KoreanWarRefugeeWithBaby.jpg|thumb|Korean civilians pass an [[M46 Patton|M-46]] tank]][[File:KoreanWarFallenSoldier1.jpg|thumb|A GI comforts a grieving infantryman.]]Despite the rapid post–Second World War Allied demobilizations, there were substantial US forces occupying Japan; under General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s command, they could be made ready to fight the North Koreans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokesbury1990&quot;/&gt;{{rp|42}} Only the [[British Commonwealth Forces Korea|British Commonwealth]] had comparable forces in the area.On Saturday, 24 June 1950, US Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] informed President Truman by telephone, &quot;Mr. President, I have very serious news.

The President disagreed with advisors who recommended unilateral US bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the [[United States Seventh Fleet|US Seventh Fleet]] to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Government]] asked to fight in Korea.

To counter the possibility of American invasion, Zhou Enlai secured a Soviet commitment to have the USSR support Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed 260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of [[Gao Gang]]. Zhou commanded [[Chai Chengwen]] to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed [[Lei Yingfu]], Zhou's military advisor in Korea, to analyze the military situation in Korea.  Lei concluded that [[Douglas MacArthur|Macarthur]] would most likely attempt a landing at [[Incheon]]. After conferring with Mao that this would be MacArthur's most likely strategy, Zhou briefed Soviet and North Korean advisers of Lei's findings, and issued orders to Chinese army commanders deployed on the Korean border to prepare for American naval activity in the [[Korea Strait]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 141&lt;/ref&gt;===Escalation (August – September 1950)===[[File:Korean War, train attack.jpg|left|thumb|The [[U.S. Air Force]] attacking railroads south of [[Wonsan]] on the eastern coast of North Korea.]]In the resulting [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter]] (August–September 1950), the US Army withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at [[Battle of Naktong Bulge|the Naktong Bulge]], [[Battle of P'ohang-dong|P'ohang-dong]], and [[Battle of Taegu|Taegu]].

These commitments did little to directly address the problems confronting PVA troops.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 148&lt;/ref&gt;In the months after the Shanyang conference Peng Dehuai went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. Peng was convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the foreseeable future.  On February 24, 1952, the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Military Commission]], presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort.  All of them emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, who, in an angry outburst, shouted: &quot;You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have!  Not to speak of the casualties!  For what are they giving their lives?  We have no aircraft.  We have only a few guns.  Transports are not protected.  More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can't you overcome some of your difficulties?&quot;  The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings, where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots, to provide more anti-aircraft guns to the front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and, to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 148-149&lt;/ref&gt;===Armistice (July 1953 – November 1954)===The on again, off again armistice negotiations continued for two years,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokesbury1990&quot;/&gt;{{rp|144–53}} first at Kaesong (southern North Korea), then relocated at [[Panmunjom]] (bordering the Koreas).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokesbury1990&quot;/&gt;{{rp|147}} A major, problematic negotiation point was [[prisoner of war]] (POW) repatriation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokesbury1990&quot;/&gt;{{rp|187–99}} The PVA, KPA, and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/korea/boose.html|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070712210732/http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/korea/boose.html|archivedate= 2007-07-12 |title= Fighting While Talking: The Korean War Truce Talks|author= Boose, Donald W., Jr.|date= Spring 2000|work= OAH Magazine of History|publisher= Organization of American Historians|accessdate=7 November 2009 |quote= &quot;...the UNC advised that only 70,000 out of over 170,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners desired repatriation.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokesbury1990&quot;/&gt;{{rp|189–90}} In the final armistice agreement, a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was set up to handle the matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokesbury1990&quot;/&gt;{{rp|242–5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.koreanwar-educator.org/topics/united_nations/uncreg/index.htm|title= Korean War Educator: United Nations: Command Repatriation Group|author= Hamblen, A.L.|publisher= Korean War Educator|accessdate=7 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1952 the US elected a new president, and on 29 November 1952, the president-elect, [[Dwight D.

Madhava Panikkar]], reports &quot;that Truman announced that he was thinking of using the atom bomb in Korea. But the Chinese seemed totally unmoved by this threat ... The propaganda against American aggression was stepped up. The 'Aid Korea to resist America' campaign was made the slogan for increased production, greater national integration, and more rigid control over anti-national activities.

The matter of atomic warfare was solely a US decision, not the collective decision of the UN. Truman met on 4 December 1950 with UK prime minister and Commonwealth spokesman [[Clement Attlee]], French Premier [[René Pleven]], and Foreign Minister [[Robert Schuman]] to discuss their worries about atomic warfare and its likely continental expansion. The US's forgoing atomic warfare was not because of &quot;a disinclination by the USSR and PRC to escalate&quot; the Korean War, but because UN allies—notably from the UK, the Commonwealth, and France—were concerned about a [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the US fought China, who then might persuade the USSR to conquer Western Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Truman |first =Harry S |authorlink =Harry S.

Lawton Collins]] (Army Chief of Staff), General MacArthur, Admiral [[C. Turner Joy]], General [[George E. Stratemeyer]], and staff officers Major General Doyle Hickey, Major General [[Charles A. Willoughby]], and Major General Edwin K. Wright, met in Tokyo to plan strategy countering the Chinese intervention; they considered three potential atomic warfare scenarios encompassinging the next weeks and months of warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;* In the first scenario: If the PVA continued attacking in full and the UN Command is forbidden to blockade and bomb China, and without Nationalist Chinese reinforcements, and without an increase in US forces until April 1951 (four [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] divisions were due to arrive), then atomic bombs might be used in North Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;* In the second scenario: If the PVA continued full attacks and the UN Command have blockaded China and have effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing of the Chinese interior, and the Nationalist Chinese soldiers are maximally exploited, and tactical atomic bombing is to hand, then the UN forces could hold positions deep in North Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;* In the third scenario: if the PRC agreed to not cross the 38th parallel border, General MacArthur recommended UN acceptance of an armistice disallowing PVA and KPA troops south of the parallel, and requiring PVA and KPA guerrillas to withdraw northwards. The US Eighth Army would remain to protect the Seoul–Incheon area, while X Corps would retreat to Pusan. A UN commission should supervise implementation of the armistice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schnabel&quot; /&gt;In 1951, the US escalated closest to atomic warfare in Korea. Because the PRC had deployed new armies to the Sino-Korean frontier, pit crews at the [[Kadena Air Base]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], assembled atomic bombs for Korean warfare, &quot;lacking only the essential [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]] nuclear cores.&quot; In October 1951, the US effected ''Operation Hudson Harbor'' to establish nuclear weapons capability. USAF B-29 bombers practised individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs), coordinated from [[Yokota Air Base]] in east-central Japan. ''Hudson Harbor'' tested &quot;actual functioning of all activities which would be involved in an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, ground control of bomb aiming&quot;. The bombing run data indicated that atomic bombs would be tactically ineffective against massed infantry, because the &quot;timely identification of large masses of enemy troops was extremely rare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last =Hasbrouck |first = SV |title =memo to file (November 7, 1951), G-3 Operations file, box 38-A |publisher =Library of Congress |year =1951 |postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last =Army Chief of Staff |title =memo to file (November 20, 1951), G-3 Operations file, box 38-A |publisher = Library of Congress |year =1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Watson |first =Robert J |coauthors =Schnabel, James F. |title =The Joint Chiefs of Staff and National Policy, 1950–1951, The Korean War and 1951–1953, The Korean War (History of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Volume III, Parts I and II) |publisher =Office of Joint History, Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff |year=1998 |pages =part 1, p. v; part 2, p. 614 |nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last =Commanding General, Far East Air Force |title =Memo to 98th Bomb Wing Commander, Okinawa |year =1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last =Far East Command G-2 Theater Intelligence |title =Résumé of Operation, Record Group 349, box 752 |year =1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Shootingkoreancivilians.jpg|thumb|'''MEMO (25 Jul ’50) to Gen.

Mao primarily supported intervention not to save North Korea or to appease the Soviet Union, but because he believed that a military conflict with the United States was inevitable after UN forces crossed the 38th parallel. A secondary motive of Mao's was to improve his own prestige inside the communist international community by demonstrating that his Marxist concerns were international. In his later years Mao believed that Stalin only gained a positive opinion of him after China's entrance into the Korean War. Inside China, the war improved the long-term prestige of Mao, Zhou, and Peng.&lt;ref name=&quot;BY150&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 150&lt;/ref&gt;China emerged from the Korean War united by a sense of national pride, despite the war's enormous costs. The Chinese people were educated to believe that the war was initiated by the United States and Korea, and not by a fraternal communist state in the north. In Chinese propaganda, the Chinese war effort was portrayed and accepted as an example of China's engaging the strongest power in the world with an under-equipped army, forcing it to retreat, and fighting it to a military stalemate. These successes were contrasted with China's historical humiliations by Japan and by Western powers over the previous hundred years in order to promote the image of the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]].  The most significant negative long-term consequence of the war (for China) was that it led the United States to guarantee the safety of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in Taiwan, effectively ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control until the present day.&lt;ref name=&quot;BY150&quot; /&gt;===Defection===[[Operation Moolah]] was a [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) effort during the Korean War to capture a fully mission capable Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]].&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Herbert|title=OPERATION MOOLAH: The Plot to Steal a MiG-15|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/Moolah.html|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Futrell|first=Robert|title=United States Air Force operations in the Korean conflict, 1 July 1952-27 July 1953|year=1956|publisher=USAF Historical Division|location=Maxwell Air Force Base|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MiG-15 was introduced by Communist forces on November 1, 1950 over the skies of [[Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stratemeyer|first=George|title=The three wars of Lt.

The Korean War established proxy war as one way that the nuclear [[superpower]]s indirectly conducted their rivalry in third-party countries. The [[NSC-68]] Containment Policy extended the cold war from occupied Europe to the rest of the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}===DMZ===Fighting ended at the 38th parallel and the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]], a strip of land 248x4&amp;nbsp;km (155x2.5&amp;nbsp;mi), now divides the two countries. Even so, skirmishes, incursions, and incidents between the combatants have continued since the Armistice was signed.===Racial integration of U.S. Forces===The beginning of racial integration efforts in the U.S. military began during the Korean War, where [[African American]]s fought in integrated units for the first time.
