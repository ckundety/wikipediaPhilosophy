However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]].&lt;/ref&gt;Physics is one of the oldest [[academic discipline]]s, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of [[natural philosophy]] along with [[chemistry]], certain branches of [[mathematics]], and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 16th century, the [[natural science]]s emerged as unique research programs in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].&lt;/ref&gt; Certain research areas are [[interdisciplinary]], such as [[biophysics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], which means that the boundaries of physics are not [[demarcation problem|rigidly defined]]. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [[physicalism]] emerged as a major unifying feature of the [[philosophy of science]] as physics provides fundamental explanations for every [[observation|observed]] natural [[phenomenon]]. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening to new research areas in mathematics and philosophy.Physics is also significant and influential through advances in its understanding that have translated into new [[technology|technologies]]. For example, advances in the understanding of [[electromagnetism]] or [[nuclear physics]] led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as [[television]], [[computer]]s, [[domestic appliance]]s, and [[nuclear weapon]]s; advances in [[thermodynamics]] led to the development of [[industrialization]]; and advances in [[mechanics]] inspired the development of [[calculus]].==History==[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Isaac Newton (1643–1727)]][[File:Einstein1921 by F Schmutzer 2.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Albert Einstein (1879-1955)]]{{Main|History of physics}}&lt;!-- Please do not add too much links --&gt;What we call Magic, Myth, Religion, Natural Philosophy, Physical science, and Physics, one by one replaced each other as the means we use to understand and affect the behavior of nature.'''Natural Phylosophy''' Was proposed in Archaic Greece (650 BCE – 480 BCE) when [[Presocratics]] like [[Thales]] refused supernatural, religious or mythological explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, C.

It continues to this day.== Philosophy =={{Details|Philosophy of physics}}Physics in many ways stems from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. From [[Thales]]' first attempt to characterize matter, to [[Democritus]]' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] of a crystalline [[firmament]], and Aristotle's book ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', different Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Well into the 18th century, physics was known as [[natural philosophy]].By the 19th century physics was realized as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on [[philosophy of science]] to give an adequate description of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Alex|title=Philosophy of Science|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0-415-34317-8}} See Chapter 1 for a discussion on the necessity of philosophy of science.&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method employs [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori reasoning]] as well as [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a posteriori]] reasoning and the use of [[Bayesian inference]] to measure the validity of a given theory.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003), Chapter 14 &quot;Bayesianism and Modern Theories of Evidence&quot; ''Theory and Reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science'' ISBN 0-226-30063-3&lt;/ref&gt;The development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers, but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the [[philosophy of physics]], involves issues such as the nature of [[space]] and [[time]], [[determinism]], and metaphysical outlooks such as [[empiricism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003), Chapter 15 &quot;Empiricism, Naturalism, and Scientific Realism?&quot; ''Theory and Reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science'' ISBN 0-226-30063-3&lt;/ref&gt;Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance [[Laplace]], who championed [[causal determinism]],&lt;ref&gt;See Laplace, Pierre Simon, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities'', translated from the 6th French edition by Frederick Wilson Truscott and Frederick Lincoln Emory, Dover Publications (New York, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who wrote on [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics&quot; Ox Bow Press (1995) ISBN 1-881987-09-4. and &quot;My View of the World&quot; Ox Bow Press (1983) ISBN 0-918024-30-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]] has been called a [[Platonism|Platonist]] by [[Stephen Hawking]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose (1996), ''The Nature of Space and Time'' ISBN 0-691-05084-8 p.4 &quot;I think that Roger is a Platonist at heart but he must answer for himself.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; a view Penrose discusses in his book, ''[[The Road to Reality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Penrose, ''The Road to Reality'' ISBN 0-679-45443-8&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking refers to himself as an &quot;unashamed reductionist&quot; and takes issue with Penrose's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Penrose|first=Roger|coauthors=Abner Shimony, Nancy Cartwright, Stephen Hawking|title=The Large, the Small and the Human Mind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=0-521-78572-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;== Core theories =={{Further|[[Branches of physics]], [[Classical physics]], [[Modern physics]], [[Topic outline of physics]]}}While physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories are used by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found correct as an approximation of nature (within a certain domain of validity). For instance, the theory of [[Classical physics|classical]] mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than [[atom]]s and moving at much less than the [[speed of light]]. These theories continue to be areas of active research, and a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as [[chaos theory|chaos]] was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727).These central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of his or her specialization, is expected to be literate in them. These include [[classical mechanics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[special relativity]].=== Fundamental physics ===[[Image:Modernphysicsfields.svg|thumb|350px|right|The basic domains of physics]]While physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability. Loosely speaking, the laws of [[classical physics]] accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain, observations do not match their predictions. [[Albert Einstein]] contributed the framework of [[special relativity]], which replaced notions of [[absolute time and space]] with [[spacetime]] and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light. [[Max Planck]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], and others introduced [[quantum mechanics]], a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, [[quantum field theory]] unified [[quantum mechanics]] and [[special relativity]]. [[General relativity]] allowed for a dynamical, curved [[spacetime]], with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well described. General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidates theories of [[quantum gravity]] are being developed.{{clear}}== Relation to other fields ==[[File:Pahoeoe fountain original.jpg|thumb|This [[parabola]]-shaped [[lava flow]] illustrates the application of Mathematics in Physics &amp;ndash; in this case, [[Galileo]]'s [[law of falling bodies]].]][[File:Physics and other sciences.png|thumb|left|Mathematics and Ontology are used in Physics. Physics is used in Chemistry and Cosmology.]]=== Prerequisites ===Mathematics is the language used for compact description of the order in nature, especially the laws of Physics. This was noted and advocated by Pythagoras,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getcited.org/pub/102471397&lt;/ref&gt; Plato,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The story of mathematics|url=w.storyofmathematics.com/greek_plato.html|quote=Although usually remembered today as a philosopher, Plato was also one of ancient Greece’s most important patrons of mathematics. Inspired by Pythagoras, he founded his Academy in Athens in 387 BC, where he stressed mathematics as a way of understanding more about reality. In particular, he was convinced that geometry was the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe. The sign above the Academy entrance read: “Let no-one ignorant of geometry enter here.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes. I mean the universe, but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word of it, and without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.&quot; – [[Galileo]] (1623), ''[[The Assayer]]'', as quoted by G. Toraldo Di Francia (1976), ''The Investigation of the Physical World'' ISBN 0-521-29925-X p.10&lt;/ref&gt; and Newton.Physics theories use Mathematics&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/tour_sci.html&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain order and provide precise formulas, [[analytic solution|precise]] or [[simulation#Computer simulation|estimated]] solutions, quantitative results and predictions. Experiment results in physics are numerical measurements. Technologies based on Mathematics, like [[scientific computing|computation]] have made [[computational physics]] an active area of research.[[File:Mathematical Physics and other sciences.png|thumb|The distinction between Mathematics and Physics is clear-cut, but not always obvious, especially in Mathematical Physics.]]Ontology is a prerequisite for Physics, but not for Mathematics. It means Physics ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while Mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world. Thus Physics statements are synthetic, while Math statements are analytic. Mathematics contains hypothesis, while Physics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of Physics statements must match observed and experimental data.The distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example, Mathematical Physics is the application of Mathematics in Physics. Its methods are Mathematical, but its subject is Physical.&lt;ref&gt;The application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories.&quot; Definition from the ''Journal of Mathematical Physics''. http://jmp.aip.org/jmp/staff.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; The problems in this field start with a &quot;[[Boundary condition|Math model of a Physical situation]]&quot; and a &quot;Math description of a Physical law&quot;. Every math statement used for solution has a hard-to-find Physical meaning. The final Mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.Physics is a branch of [[fundamental science]], not [[practical science]].&lt;ref&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science, Science. 1917. Page 645&lt;/ref&gt; Physics is also called &quot;the fundamental science&quot; because the subject of study of all branches of [[natural science]] like Chemistry, Astronomy, Geology and Biology are constrained by laws of physics.&lt;ref name = &quot;Feynman lectures&quot;/&gt; For example, Chemistry studies properties, structures, and [[chemical reaction|reactions]] of the matter, including atoms, molecules, solids, liquids and gases. Properties are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of their energy, mass and charge. Structures are formed because particles exert forces on each other, like electrical force and gravity. And reactions are a change in properties and forces that formed a structure, like the different ways in which atoms form molecules.Physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine. &lt;!-- Please add a phrase about how physics first caused industrial revolution, with reliable source --&gt;{{clear}}=== Application and influence ===[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|150px|[[Archimedes' screw]], a [[simple machine]] for lifting.]][[File:IMG 1729 Gemaal met schroef van Archimedes bij Kinderdijk.JPG|thumb|150px|application in lifting liquids]]{{Main|Applied physics}}[[Applied physics]] is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular [[Utility|use]]. An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from [[engineering]] in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.The approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. Applied physicists can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research. For instance, people working on [[accelerator physics]] might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.Physics is used heavily in [[engineering]]. For example, [[Statics]], a subfield of [[mechanics]], is used in the building of [[bridge]]s and other structures. The understanding and use of [[acoustics]] results in better concert halls; similarly, the use of [[optics]] creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic [[flight simulator]]s, video games, and movies, and is often critical in [[forensic]] investigations.With the [[Uniformitarianism (science)|standard consensus]] that the [[Scientific law|laws]] of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in [[uncertainty]]. For example, in the [[History of Earth#Origin of the Earth's core and first atmosphere|study of the origin of the Earth]], one can reasonably model Earth's [[mass]], [[temperature]], and rate of [[rotation]], over [[time]]. It also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology.But there is also considerable [[interdisciplinarity]] in the physicist's methods, and so many other important fields are influenced by physics: e.g. presently the fields of [[econophysics]] plays an important role, as well as sociophysics.== Research ===== Scientific method ===Physicists use a [[scientific method]] to test the validity of a [[physical theory]], using a methodical approach to compare the implications of the theory in question with the associated conclusions drawn from [[experiment]]s and observations conducted to test it. Experiments and observations are to be collected and matched with the predictions and hypotheses made by a theory, thus aiding in the determination or the validity/invalidity of the theory.Theories which are very well supported by data and have never failed any competent empirical test are often called [[scientific law]]s, or natural laws. Of course, all theories, including those called scientific laws, can always be replaced by more accurate, generalized statements if a disagreement of theory with observed data is ever found.&lt;ref&gt;Some principles, such as [[Newton's laws of motion]], are still generally called &quot;laws&quot; even though they are now known to be limiting cases of newer theories. Thus, for example, in [[Thomas Brody]] (1993, Luis de la Peña and Peter Hodgson, eds.) ''The Philosophy Behind Physics'' ISBN 0-387-55914-0, pp 18–24 (Chapter 2), explains the 'epistemic cycle' in which a student of physics discovers that physics is not a finished product but is instead the process of creating [that product].&lt;/ref&gt;=== Theory and experiment ==={{Main|Theoretical physics|Experimental physics}}[[Image:Astronaut-EVA.jpg|thumb|right|The [[astronaut]] and [[Earth]] are both in [[free-fall]]]][[Image:Lightning in Arlington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lightning]] is an [[electric current]]]]Theorists seek to develop [[mathematical model]]s that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although theory and experiment are developed separately, they are strongly dependent upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories cannot explain, or when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire new experiments.Physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenologists]]. Phenomenologists look at the complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to fundamental theory.Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy; [[electromagnetism]] was unified this way.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the influence of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter|Ritter]] on [[Hans Christian Ørsted|Oersted]].&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues,&lt;ref&gt;Concepts which are denoted ''hypothetical'' can change with time. For example, the [[atom]] of nineteenth century physics was denigrated by some, including [[Ernst Mach]]'s critique of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s formulation of [[statistical mechanics]]. By the end of [[World War II]], the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universes]], a [[Multiverse (science)|multiverse]], and [[higher dimension]]s. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories. They then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.[[Experiment]]al physics informs, and is informed by, [[engineering]] and [[technology]].  Experimental physicists involved in [[basic research]] design and perform experiments with equipment such as [[particle accelerator]]s and [[laser]]s, whereas those involved in [[applied research]] often work in industry, developing technologies such as [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]] and [[transistor]]s. Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well explored by theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feynman|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Feynman|title=The Character of Physical Law|year=1965|isbn=0262560038}} p.157: &quot;In fact experimenters have a certain individual character. They ... very often do their experiments in a region in which people know the theorist has not made any guesses. &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}=== Scope and aims ===[[Image:Acceleration components.JPG|thumb|left|Physics involves modeling the natural world with theory, usually quantitative. Here, the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of [[calculus]] to explain its behavior: the purview of the branch of physics known as [[mechanics]].]]Physics covers a wide range of [[phenomenon|phenomena]], from [[elementary particle]]s (such as quarks, neutrinos and electrons) to the largest [[superclusters]] of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore physics is sometimes called the &quot;[[fundamental science]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Feynman lectures&quot;&gt;''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' Volume I. Feynman, Leighton and Sands. ISBN 0-201-02115-3  See Chapter 3 : &quot;The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences&quot; for a general discussion. For the philosophical issue of whether other sciences can be &quot;reduced&quot; to physics, see [[reductionism]] and [[special sciences]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to [[root cause]]s, and then connect these causes together.For example, the [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] observed that certain rocks ([[lodestone]]) were attracted to one another by some invisible force. This effect was later called [[magnetism]], and was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. A little earlier than the Chinese, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] knew of other objects such as [[amber]], that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two. This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century, and came to be called [[electricity]]. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force – [[electromagnetism]]. This process of &quot;unifying&quot; forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the [[weak nuclear force]] are now considered to be two aspects of the [[electroweak interaction]]. Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason ([[Theory of Everything]]) for why nature is as it is (see section ''[[#Current research|Current research]]'' below for more information).=== Research fields ===Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into [[condensed matter physics]]; [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]; [[particle physics]]; [[astrophysics]]; [[geophysics]] and [[biophysics]]. Some physics departments also support research in [[Physics education]].Since the twentieth century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly [[specialization of knowledge|specialized]], and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. &quot;Universalists&quot; such as [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) and [[Lev Landau]] (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Yet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the [[World Wide Web]], which was innovated at [[CERN]] by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. The same might be said for [[arXiv.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{hidden|&lt;span style&quot;border: 1px #aaa solid&quot;&gt;Table of the major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories they employ&lt;/span&gt;|{{Subfields of physics}}|bg1=#f2f2f2}}==== Condensed matter ===={{Main|Condensed matter physics}}[[Image:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|350px|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms, confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter, the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]]][[Condensed matter physics]] is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of [[matter]]. In particular, it is concerned with the &quot;condensed&quot; [[phase (matter)|phases]] that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong.The most familiar examples of condensed phases are [[Solid-state physics|solids]] and [[liquid]]s, which arise from the bonding and [[electromagnetic force]] between [[atom]]s. More exotic condensed phases include the [[superfluid]] and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] found in certain atomic systems at very low [[temperature]], the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by [[conduction electron]]s in certain materials, and the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spin]]s on [[crystal lattice|atomic lattices]].Condensed matter physics is by far the largest field of contemporary physics. Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of [[solid-state physics]], which is now considered one of its main subfields. The term ''condensed matter physics'' was apparently coined by [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]] when he renamed his research group — previously ''solid-state theory'' — in 1967.In 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics at the [[American Physical Society]] was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics.&lt;ref name=dcmp_governance&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://dcmp.bc.edu/page.php?name=governance_history | title = Division of Condensed Matter Physics Governance History | accessdate = 13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Condensed matter physics has a large overlap with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[engineering]].==== Atomic, molecular, and optical physics ===={{Main|Atomic, molecular, and optical physics}}[[Atom]]ic, [[Molecule|molecular]], and [[Optics|optical]] physics (AMO) is the study of [[matter]]-matter and [[light]]-matter interactions on the scale of single [[atom]]s or structures containing a few atoms. The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of the [[energy]] scales that are relevant. All three areas include both [[classical physics|classical]] and [[quantum physics|quantum]] treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).[[Atomic physics]] studies the [[electron]] shells of [[atom]]s.  Current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions, low-temperature collision dynamics, the collective behavior of atoms in weakly interacting gases (Bose–Einstein Condensates and dilute Fermi degenerate systems), precision measurements of fundamental constants, and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics.  Atomic physics is influenced by the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (see, e.g., [[hyperfine splitting]]), but intra-nuclear phenomenon such as [[nuclear fission|fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] are considered part of [[high energy physics]].[[Molecular physics]] focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light.  [[Optical physics]] is distinct from [[optics]] in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects, but on the fundamental properties of [[optical field]]s and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.==== High energy/particle physics ===={{Main|Particle physics}}[[Image:CMS Higgs-event.jpg|thumb|A simulated event in the CMS detector of the [[Large Hadron Collider]], featuring a possible appearance of the [[Higgs boson]].]][[Particle physics]] is the study of the [[elementary particle|elementary]] constituents of [[matter]] and [[energy]], and the [[interactions]] between them. It may also be called &quot;high energy physics&quot;, because many elementary particles do not occur naturally, but are created only during high energy [[collision]]s of other particles, as can be detected in [[particle accelerator]]s.Currently, the interactions of elementary particles are described by the [[Standard Model]]. The model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter ([[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s) that interact via the [[strong nuclear force|strong]], [[weak nuclear force|weak]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[fundamental force]]s.  Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging [[gauge boson]]s ([[gluon]]s, [[W and Z bosons]], and [[photon]]s, respectively). The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the [[Higgs boson]], the existence of which has not yet been verified; {{as of|2010|lc=on}}, searches for it are underway in the [[Tevatron]] at [[Fermilab]] and in the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].==== Astrophysics ===={{Main|Astrophysics|Physical cosmology}}[[Image:Hubble ultra deep field high rez edit1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The deepest visible-light image of the [[universe]], the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]]][[Astrophysics]] and [[astronomy]] are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of [[stellar structure]], [[stellar evolution]], the origin of the [[solar system]], and related problems of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.The discovery by [[Karl Jansky]] in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of [[radio astronomy]]. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the earth’s atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for [[infrared astronomy|infrared]], [[ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet]], [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]], and [[X-ray astronomy]].[[Physical cosmology]] is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]]'s discovery that the universe was expanding, as shown by the [[Hubble diagram]], prompted rival explanations known as the [[steady state theory|steady state]] universe and the [[Big Bang]].The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the [[cosmological principle]]. Cosmologists have recently established the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]] of the evolution of the universe, which includes [[cosmic inflation]], [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]].Numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/main/questions_answers.html|title=NASA - Q&amp;A on the GLAST Mission |accessdate=29 April 2009 |work=Nasa: Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/index.html Nasa - Fermi Science] and [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/unidentified_sources.html NASA - Scientists Predict Major Discoveries for GLAST].&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding [[dark matter]] is possible over the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/dark_matter.html NASA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of [[weakly interacting massive particle]]s, complementing similar experiments with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and other underground detectors.[[IBEX]] is already yielding new [[Astrophysics|astrophysical]] discoveries:  &quot;No one knows what is creating the [[energetic neutral atom|ENA (energetic neutral atoms)]] ribbon&quot; along the [[termination shock]] of the [[solar wind]], &quot;but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the [[heliosphere]] — in which the solar system's enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind's charged particles is plowing through the onrushing 'galactic wind' of the interstellar medium in the shape of a comet — is wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Richard A.

Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable [[spintronics]] and [[quantum computer]]s.In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that [[neutrino]]s have non-zero [[mass]]. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing [[solar neutrino problem]], and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. [[Particle accelerator]]s have begun probing energy scales in the [[TeV]] range, in which experimentalists are hoping to find evidence for the [[Higgs boson]] and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric particles]].&lt;ref&gt;584 co-authors &quot;Direct observation of the strange 'b' baryon &lt;math&gt;\Xi_{b}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; Fermilab-Pub-07/196-E, June 12, 2007http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1690v2 finds a mass of 5.774 GeV for the &lt;math&gt;\Xi_{b}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Theoretical attempts to unify [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] into a single theory of [[quantum gravity]], a program ongoing for over half a century, have not yet been decisively resolved. The current leading candidates are [[M-theory]], [[superstring theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].Many [[astronomy|astronomical]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained, including the existence of [[GZK paradox|ultra-high energy cosmic rays]], the [[baryon asymmetry]], the [[accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]] and the [[galaxy rotation problem|anomalous rotation rates of galaxies]].Although much progress has been made in high-energy, [[quantum]], and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving [[complex systems|complexity]], [[Chaos theory|chaos]], or [[turbulence]] are still poorly understood.{{citation needed|time=2010-11-03|date=November 2010}} Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling [[water]], the shape of water [[droplet]]s, mechanisms of [[surface tension]] [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]], and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.{{citation needed|time=2010-11-03|date=November 2010}}These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern [[mathematics|mathematical]] methods and [[computers]], which enabled [[complex systems]] to be modeled in new ways.  Complex physics has become part of increasingly [[interdisciplinary]] research, as exemplified by the study of [[turbulence]] in [[aerodynamics]] and the observation of [[pattern formation]] in [[biology|biological]] systems. In 1932, [[Horace Lamb]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Goldstein | first=Sydney| title=Fluid Mechanics in the First Half of this Century| journal=Annual Reviews in Fluid Mechanics| year=1969 | volume=1 | pages=1–28| doi=10.1146/annurev.fl.01.010169.000245 |bibcode = 1969AnRFM...1....1G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids.
