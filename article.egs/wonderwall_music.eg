The songs are virtually all instrumental, except for some non-English vocals and a slowed-down [[spoken word]] track. The songs were recorded in December 1967 in England, and January 1968 in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[India]]. ''Wonderwall Music'' is notable for being the first official solo album by one of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]&lt;ref&gt;The soundtrack of the film ''[[The Family Way (soundtrack)|The Family Way]]'', composed primarily by [[Paul McCartney]], was issued in January 1967, but the album contains only [[incidental music]], not performed by McCartney.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apple Records]]' first LP release.==Recording==The recordings for the album were started in December 1967 in England. The rest was recorded in January 1968 in Bombay, India. Also recorded during the Indian sessions was the backing track to &quot;[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]&quot;, which became the [[B-side]] to &quot;[[Lady Madonna]]&quot;, the final Beatles single on [[Parlophone Records]].Some of the musician's credits are pseudonyms for George Harrison, [[Eric Clapton]], and [[Ringo Starr]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Harrison is listed merely as producer, arranger and writer for the album. [[Peter Tork]] of [[The Monkees]] also played [[banjo]] (specifically, one borrowed from [[Paul McCartney]]), but was not credited.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}All of the tracks were composed by Harrison, and it was the first official solo album by a Beatle. It was the first album release on the newly formed [[Apple Records]], appearing in November 1968, a few weeks before ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]''. It would also be the first Apple record to be deleted, though it was remastered and reissued on CD in 1992.In the CD liner notes, Harrison's description of the recording done in England is revealing: &quot;I had a regular wind-up stopwatch and I watched the film to 'spot-in' the music with the watch. I wrote the timings down in my book, then I'd go to Abbey Road, make up a piece, record it.&quot; While the tracks recorded in England were made on [[multitrack recording]] machines and [[remixing|remixed]], the Indian portions were recorded live to two-track stereo.==Chart history==''Wonderwall Music'' did not chart at all in the United Kingdom, but reached #49 in the United States in the early part of 1969.==Cultural impact==[[Britpop]] band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], well-known for their Beatles influences and motifs, had a hit with a song called &quot;[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]&quot; in the 1990s, whose title refers to the movie.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}==Track listing==All songs by [[George Harrison]].===Side One===#&quot;Microbes&quot; – 3:42#&quot;Red Lady Too&quot; – 1:56#&quot;Tabla and Pakavaj&quot; – 1:05#&quot;In the Park&quot; – 4:08#&quot;[[Drilling a Home]]&quot; – 3:08#&quot;Guru Vandana&quot; – 1:05#&quot;Greasy Legs&quot; – 1:28#&quot;Ski-ing&quot; – 1:50#&quot;Gat Kirwani&quot; – 1:15#&quot;Dream Scene&quot; – 5:26#&quot;Party Seacombe&quot; – 4:34===Side Two===#&quot;Love Scene&quot; – 4:17#&quot;Crying&quot; – 1:15#&quot;Cowboy Music&quot; – 1:29#&quot;Fantasy Sequins&quot; – 1:50#&quot;On the Bed&quot; – 1:05#&quot;Glass Box&quot; – 2:22#&quot;Wonderwall to Be Here&quot; – 1:25#&quot;Singing Om&quot; – 1:54Tracks 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 and 18 were recorded in England, while tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 19 were recorded in India.==Personnel=====England (December 1967)===*[[John Barham]] – [[piano]] and [[flügelhorn]]*[[Remo Four (The)|Colin Manley]] – [[guitar]] and [[steel guitar]]*[[Tony Ashton]] – jangle piano and [[organ (music)|organ]]*[[Remo Four (The)|Philip Rogers]] – [[bass guitar|bass]]*[[Remo Four (The)|Roy Dyke]] – [[Drum kit|drums]]*[[Tommy Reilly]] – [[harmonica]]*Eddie Clayton ([[Eric Clapton]]) – guitar*Richie Snare ([[Ringo Starr]]) – drums*[[Peter Tork]] – [[banjo]] (uncredited)===India (January 1968)===*[[Aashish Khan]] – [[sarod]]*Mahapurush Misra – [[tabla]] and [[Pakhavaj|pakavaj]]*Sharad Jadev – [[shehnai]]*Hanuman Jadev – shehnai*Shambu-Das – [[sitar]]*Indril Bhattacharya – sitar*Shankar Ghosh – sitar*Chandra Shekhar – [[surbahar]]*Shivkumar Sharma – [[santoor]]*S.
