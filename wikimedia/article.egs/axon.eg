Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features, including shape (dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites usually receive signals while axons usually transmit them).  All of these rules have exceptions, however.Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites.  No neuron ever has more than one axon; however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, K.-W. (1976) Receptive fields, geometry and conduction block of sensory neurones in the CNS of the leech. J. Physiol. (Lond) 263:513-538.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most axons branch, in some cases very profusely.Axons make contact with other cells—usually other neurons but sometimes muscle or gland cells—at junctions called [[synapse]]s.  At a synapse, the membrane of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell, and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or electrochemical signals across the gap.  Some synaptic junctions appear partway along an axon as it extends—these are called ''en passant'' (&quot;in passing&quot;) synapses.  Other synapses appear as terminals at the ends of axonal branches.  A single axon, with all its branches taken together, can [[innervate]] multiple parts of the brain and generate thousands of synaptic terminals.== Anatomy ==Axons are in effect the primary transmission lines of the [[nervous system]], and as bundles they help make up [[nerve]]s. Individual axons are microscopic in diameter (typically about 1[[micrometre|μm]] across), but may be up to several feet in length. The longest axons in the human body, for example, are those of the [[sciatic nerve]], which run from the base of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] to the big toe of each foot. These single-cell fibers of the sciatic nerve may extend a meter or even longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaftb.org/dnaftb/6/concept/index.html DNA From The Beginning, section 6: 	Genes are real things., &quot;Amination&quot; section, final slide]&lt;/ref&gt;In [[vertebrate]]s, the axons of many neurons are sheathed in [[myelin]], which is formed by either of two types of [[glia|glial cells]]: [[Schwann cell]]s ensheathing [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] neurons and [[oligodendrocyte]]s insulating those of the [[central nervous system]]. Along myelinated nerve fibers, gaps in the sheath known as [[nodes of Ranvier]] occur at evenly-spaced intervals.  The myelination enables an especially rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation called [[saltatory conduction|saltation]]. The demyelination of axons is what causes the multitude of neurological symptoms found in the disease [[Multiple Sclerosis]].The axons of some neurons branch to form '''axon collaterals''', that can be divided into a number of smaller branches called '''telodendria'''. Along these the bifurcated impulse travels simultaneously to signal more than one other cell.=== Initial Segment ===The axon initial segment (AIS) consists of a specialised complex of proteins which form part of the proximal axon of a neuron. It is unmyelinated, approximately 25μm in length and  functions as the site of [[action potential]] intiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Clark BD, Goldberg EM, and Rudy B| title = Electrogenic Tuning of the Axon Initial Segment| journal = Neuroscientist| volume = 15| pages = 651–668| pmid = 20007821| url = http://nro.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=20007821| accessdate = 2010-05-02| date = December, 2009| doi=10.1177/1073858409341973| pmc=2951114}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has an important role in maintaining neuronal polarity. The exact position of the AIS along the axon differs between types of neuron and its position within a single family of neurons can vary. It has recently been discovered that the location and extent of a neuron's AIS can be altered by the neuron's level of activity and that these changes are thought to influence the excitability of the neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burrone J|first=Grubb MS|title=Activity-dependent relocation of the axon initial segment fine-tunes neuronal excitability.|journal=Nature|date=June, 2010|volume=465|issue=7301|pages=1070–1074|doi=10.1038/nature09160|pmid=20543823|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7301/full/nature09160.html|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;The density of [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s is much higher here than is found in the adjacent cell body, excepting the [[axon hillock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Wollner D. and Catterall WA| title = Localization of sodium channels in axon hillocks and initial segments of retinal ganglion cells| journal = Proc.

Peripheral nerve fibers can be classified based on axonal conduction velocity, mylenation, fiber size etc. For example, there are slow-conducting unmyelinated [[C fiber]]s and faster-conducting myelinated [[A delta fiber|Aδ fiber]]s. More complex mathematical modeling continues to be done today. There are several types of sensory- as well as motorfibers.

The growth cone has a broad sheet like extension called [[lamellipodia]] which contain protrusions called [[filopodia]]. The filopodia are the mechanism by which the entire process adheres to surfaces and explores the surrounding environment. [[Actin]] plays a major role in the mobility of this system.Environments with high levels of [[cell adhesion molecule]]s or CAM's create an ideal environment for axonal growth. This seems to provide a &quot;sticky&quot; surface for axons to grow along. Examples of CAM's specific to neural systems include [[Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule|N-CAM]], neuroglial CAM or [[NgCAM]], [[TAG-1]], [[MAG (neural)|MAG]], and [[Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|DCC]], all of which are part of the [[immunoglobulin]] superfamily. Another set of molecules called [[extracellular matrix adhesion molecule]]s also provide a sticky substrate for axons to grow along. Examples of these molecules include [[laminin]], [[fibronectin]], [[tenascin]], and [[perlecan]]. Some of these are surface bound to cells and thus act as short range attractants or repellents. Others are difusible ligands and thus can have long range effects.Cells called [[guidepost cells]] assist in the guidance of neuronal axon growth. These cells are typically other, sometimes immature, neurons.==History==Some of the first intracellular recordings in a nervous system were made in the late 1930s by K. Cole and H. Curtis. [[Alan Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] also employed the [[squid giant axon]] (1939) and by 1952 they had obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of the [[action potential]], leading the formulation of the [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]].Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded jointly the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] for this work in 1963.The formulas detailing axonal conductance were extended to vertebrates in the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley equations. Erlanger and Gasser earlier developed the classification system for peripheral&lt;ref&gt;[[Sansom B]], &quot;Reflex  Isolation&quot; http://www.sansomnia.com&lt;/ref&gt; nerve fibers, based on axonal conduction velocity, [[myelin]]ation, fiber size etc.Even recently our understanding of the biochemical basis for action potential propagation has advanced, and now includes many details about individual [[ion channel]]s.==Injury=={{Main|Nerve injury}}In order of degree of severity, injury to a nerve can be described as [[neuropraxia]], [[axonotmesis]], or [[neurotmesis]].[[Concussion]] is considered a mild form of [[diffuse axonal injury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emedicine.com/pmr/topic212.htm eMedicine - Traumatic Brain Injury: Definition, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology : Article by Segun T Dawodu, MD, FAAPMR, FAANEM, CIME, DipMI(RCSed)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;==See also==*[[Nerve fiber]]*[[Nerve]]*[[Neuron]]*[[Dendrite]]*[[Synapse]]*[[Axon guidance]]*[[Pioneer axon]]*[[Electrophysiology]]==References=={{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}{{Reflist}}== External links ==* {{OklahomaHistology|3_09}} - &quot;Slide 3 [[Spinal cord]]&quot;{{Nervous tissue}}[[Category:Neurons]][[Category:Neurophysiology]][[Category:Neuroanatomy]][[ar:محوار]][[az:Akson]][[bg:Аксон]][[ca:Axó]][[cs:Axon]][[da:Akson]][[de:Axon]][[et:Neuriit]][[el:Νευράξονας]][[es:Axón]][[eu:Axoi]][[fa:آسه]][[fr:Axone]][[gl:Axón]][[ko:축삭]][[hr:Akson]][[id:Akson]][[is:Sími (líffræði)]][[it:Assone]][[he:אקסון (סיב עצבי)]][[kk:Аксон]][[ht:Aksòn]][[la:Axon]][[lt:Aksonas]][[mk:Нервно влакно]][[nl:Axon]][[ja:神経繊維]][[no:Akson]][[pl:Neuryt]][[pt:Axónio]][[ro:Axon]][[ru:Аксон]][[simple:Axon]][[sl:Nevrit]][[sh:Akson]][[fi:Aksoni]][[sv:Axon]][[tl:Akson]][[th:แอกซอน]][[tg:Аксон]][[uk:Аксон]][[ur:محوار]][[zh:轴突]]</text></revision></page>
