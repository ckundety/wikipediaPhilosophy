Most events since the inception in 1978 were from [[Paris]], France, to [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], but due to security threats in [[Mauritania]] which led to the cancellation of the [[2008 Dakar Rally|2008 rally]], the [[2009 Dakar Rally]] was run in South America (Argentina and Chile), the first time the race took place outside of Europe and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.clutchandchrome.com/News/0901/News0901005.htm |title= Motorcycle competitors race away as Dakar Rally leaves Buenos Aires |date= 2009-01-03 |publisher= Clutch &amp; Chrome |accessdate= 2009-01-03 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has stayed in South America from 2009 to the present (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dakar.com/2010/DAK/presentation/us/r3_1-news.html#art27615 |title=DAKAR IN ARGENTINA AND CHILE |date= 2009-02-24 |publisher= ASO |accessdate= 2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autosport.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/82314 | work=Autosport}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race is open to amateur and professional entries. Amateurs typically make up about eighty percent of the participants.Despite its name it is an off-road [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]], called a [[rally raid|rally-raid]] rather than a conventional [[rally racing|rally]] — the terrain the competitors traverse is much tougher and the vehicles used are true off-road vehicles rather than the modified on-road vehicles used in rallies. Most of the competitive special sections are off-road, crossing dunes, mud, camel grass, rocks and [[erg (landform)|erg]] among others. The distances of each stage covered vary from short distances up to {{convert|800|-|900|km}} per day.==History and route==The race originated in 1978, a year after racer [[Thierry Sabine]] got lost in the [[desert]] and decided that it would be a good location for a regular rally. Originally, the rally was from [[Paris]], France, to [[Dakar]], Senegal, interrupted by a transfer across the Mediterranean. However, due to politics and other factors, the course, including origin and destination, has varied over the years. Dakar has been the destination city on all but four occasions during the period the rally was held in Africa (i.e., prior to 2009). The rally began at Paris each year until 1995. In 1994 the rally both began and ended in Paris, but due to complaints by the mayor, the finish had to be moved from the [[Champs-Élysées]] to [[Euro Disney]]. This also caused the organisation to lay out the rally through different locations in following years.===Complete list of routes===*1979–1980: Paris–Dakar*1981–1988: Paris–[[Algiers]]–Dakar*1989: Paris–[[Tunis]]–Dakar*1990–1991: Paris–[[Tripoli]]–Dakar*1992: Paris–[[Cape Town]]*1993: Paris–Dakar*1994: Paris–Dakar–Paris*1995–1996: [[Granada]]–Dakar*1997: Dakar–[[Agadez]]–Dakar*1998: Paris–Granada–Dakar*1999: [[Granada]]–Dakar*2000: Dakar–[[Cairo]]*2001: Paris–Dakar*2002: [[Arras, France|Arras]]–[[Madrid]]–Dakar*2003: [[Marseille]]–[[Sharm el-Sheikh]]*2004: [[Clermont-Ferrand]]–Dakar*2005: [[Barcelona]]–Dakar*2006–2008: [[Lisbon]]–Dakar &lt;ref&gt;The 2008 race route was planned and the race equipment was already in Lisbon when it was aborted January 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;*2009: [[Buenos Aires]]–[[Valparaíso]]–Buenos Aires&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dakar.com/2009/DAK/presentation/us/r3_5-le-parcours.html&lt;/ref&gt;*2010: Buenos Aires-[[Antofagasta]]-Buenos Aires&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dakar.com/2010/DAK/presentation/us/r3_5-le-parcours.html|title=The Route|work=2010 Dakar Argentina-Chile|publisher=Amaury Sport Organisation|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;*2011: Buenos Aires-[[Arica]]-Buenos Aires&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dakar.com/2011/DAK/presentation/us/r3_5-le-parcours.html&lt;/ref&gt;*2012: [[Mar del Plata]]-[[Copiapo]]-[[Lima]]Until the 2008 terrorist attacks, more recent rallies passed through Morocco, Western Sahara and on to the grasslands and deserts of Mauritania. The segments running through [[Atar, Mauritania|Atar]] and the sand dunes and canyons of Mauritania's [[Adrar Region]] may be the most challenging in all [[off-road racing]]. It was the Mauritania terrorist attacks that led to the demise of the classic Dakar.In 1992, [[Hubert Auriol]] won the Dakar in an automobile after having previously won the [[motorcycle]] competition on two occasions, making him the first driver to win on both two and four wheels. Later on, [[Stéphane Peterhansel]] managed to do the same. In 2001, [[Jutta Kleinschmidt]] was the first woman to win the Dakar, driving a Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero, co-driving with fellow German Andreas Schulz.The [[2008 Dakar Rally]] was canceled on January 4, 2008 amid fears of terrorist attacks. This caused serious doubts over the future of the rally. Various newspapers in Africa called the cancellation a &quot;death sentence&quot; for the race. Chile and Argentina, in South America, offered their territory to host the event, as well as the Czech Republic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://motoring.iafrica.com/worldsport/dakar/776184.htm motoring.iafrica.com | world motorsport | dakar Chile offers to host Dakar 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  or [[Hungary]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/sport/dakarali0105/ Index – Két pótvesennyel pótolnák idén a Dakart&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Central Europe]]. The ASO finally decided to establish the [[Dakar Series]] competition, whose first event was the 2008 [[Central Europe Rally]] (Hungary-Romania), between April 20 and April 26, 2008.

Many vehicle manufacturers exploit the harsh environment the rally offers as a testing ground, and consequently to demonstrate the durability of their vehicles, although most vehicles are heavily modified or purpose built.===Moto class===The Moto class is divided between three groups. Group 1 is Marathon, which are nearly unmodified production motorcycles, subdivided between engines of greater and less than {{convert|451|cc|cuin|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAK08 reglement moto&quot;&gt;http://www.dakar.com/2008/DAK/presentation/docs/DAK08_reglement_moto_us.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Group 2 is Super-Production bikes, which are more substantially modified than Marathon bikes, subdivided between engines of greater and less than 451&amp;nbsp;cc.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAK08 reglement moto&quot;/&gt; Group 3 for quads, subdivided between engines of greater and less than 500&amp;nbsp;cc.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAK08 reglement moto&quot;/&gt;Winning motorcycles include those made by [[KTM]], [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] and [[BMW Motorrad|BMW]].=== Car class—T1, T2 and Open ===[[File:Stephane_Peterhansel.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Stéphane_Peterhansel]] at Dakar 2011. He won the Dakar 9 times.]]The car class is made up of vehicles weighing less than {{convert|3500|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and subdivided into several categories. The T1 Group is made up of Improved Cross Country Vehicles and the T2 Group is made up of Cross Country Series Production vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAK08 reglement auto&quot;&gt;http://www.dakar.com/2008/DAK/presentation/docs/DAK08_reglement_auto_us.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Open class accepts weight-qualifying vehicles such as [[SCORE International]] trucks.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAK08 reglement auto&quot;/&gt;Originally, European utility vehicles like the [[Renault 4]], [[Land Rover]], [[Range Rover]], [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Mercedes-Benz G]], [[Volkswagen Iltis]] and the [[Pinzgauer High Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauer]], as well the Japanese [[Toyota Land Cruiser]], dominated the race. [[Mitsubishi Pajero|Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero]] is the most successful model in race history, including 7 years straight (2001–2007). Other manufacturers have entered heavily modified street vehicles such as [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]], [[Citroën]], [[Peugeot]] ([[Peugeot 405|405 T16]] and [[Peugeot 205|205 T16]]) and [[Porsche]].In 2003 prominent examples in the Car Class included the [[Mitsubishi Pajero|Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero]], the [[Volkswagen Touareg#Dakar rally|Volkswagen Race Touareg]], the [[Bowler Wildcat|Bowler Wildcat 200]] and the [[Nissan Navara]].[[Mercedes-Benz M-Class|Mercedes Benz M]], [[BMW X5]] and [[BMW X3]]. [[Hummer|Hummer H1]] and [[Hummer H3]] sport-utilities were represented but did not appear in the leader positions.[[Jean-Louis Schlesser]] built a series of custom [[dune buggy]] vehicles for the race and has won with them several times. American (&quot;[[Baja 1000|Baja]]&quot;) style pro trucks have also made appearances but they have seldom won. At present the main competitors in the car class are Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and BMW.===Truck class—T4 and T5===[[Image:Vladimir Chagin.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Vladimir Chagin]], ''&quot;The Tsar of Dakar&quot;'', the most successful Dakar driver in a single category. On his [[Kamaz]] truck he won the total of 7 races and 63 stages.]]The Truck class, also known as &quot;Camions&quot; or &quot;Lorries&quot;, is made up of vehicles weighing more than {{convert|3500|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robbygordon.com/cms/publish/cat_index_109.shtml |title=Dakar Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are divided into two groups, T4 and T5.T4 class trucks participate in the competition, while T5 trucks travel from bivouac to bivouac to support the competition vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictionary&quot;/&gt; T4 trucks may provide assistance during the special stages but must be [[homologation (motorsport)|homologated]] vehicles. The T4.1 class covers production trucks, and the T4.2 class covers modified trucks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dakar.com/2008/DAK/presentation/docs/DAK08_fiche_vehicule_us.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;T5 vehicles do not have to be homologated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictionary&quot;/&gt;The T4 class has been composed of vehicles manufactured by [[Tatra (car)|Tatra]], [[LIAZ (Czech Republic)|LIAZ]], [[Kamaz]], [[Hino Motors|Hino]], [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[DAF Trucks|DAF]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Unimog]], [[Renault Trucks|Renault Kerax]], [[Scania AB|SCANIA]], [[Iveco|IVECO]], and [[GINAF]]. In the 1980s, a strong rivalry between [[DAF Trucks|DAF]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] led to vehicles which had twin engines and more than 1000 [[horsepower|hp]] (750 [[kilowatt|kW]]). Later [[Tatra (car)|Tatra]], and [[Kamaz]] took the race up. After 2000, renewed competition started in the truck class between [[DAF Trucks|DAF]], [[Tatra (car)|Tatra]], [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Kamaz]].==List of winners=={| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

every day being made into a 26-minute programme. This has been commentated on by [[Toby Moody]] for ten years but Ben Constanduros Speaks on the 2011 editionThe organisers provide 20 edit stations for various countries to produce their own programmes. There are four TV helicopters, six stage cameras and three bivouac crews to make over 1,000 hours of TV over the two week period.  In the United States, coverage can be seen on the Versus network.A television documentary ''[[Race to Dakar]]'' described the experiences of a team including the actor [[Charley Boorman]] in preparation for and entry into the 2006 Dakar Rally.==Incidents=={{main|List of Dakar Rally fatal accidents}}In 1982, [[Mark Thatcher]], son of the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], along with his French co-driver [[Charlotte Verney]] and their mechanic, disappeared for six days. On January 9, the trio became separated from a convoy of vehicles after they stopped to make repairs to a faulty [[steering|steering arm]]. They were declared missing on January 12; after a large-scale search, a [[C-130 Hercules|Lockheed L100]] search plane from the [[Military of Algeria|Algerian military]] spotted their white [[Peugeot 504]] some 50&amp;nbsp;km (30&amp;nbsp;mi) off course. Thatcher, Verney and the mechanic were all unharmed.The organiser of the rally, [[Thierry Sabine]], was killed when his [[Ecureuil]] helicopter crashed at 07:30 p.m. on Tuesday 14 January 1986, into a dune at Mali during a sudden sand-storm. Also killed onboard was the singer-songwriter [[Daniel Balavoine]], helicopter pilot François-Xavier Bagnoud, journalist Nathalie Odent and Jean-Paul Lefur who was a radiophonic engineer for [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&amp;n=3580 Motorsport Memorial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;Six people were killed during the 1988 race, three participants and three local residents. In one incident, [[Baye Sibi]], a 10-year-old Malian girl, was killed by a racer while she crossed a road. A film crew's vehicle killed a mother and daughter in [[Mauritania]] on the last day of the race. The race participants killed, in three separate crashes, were a Dutch navigator on the [[DAF Trucks]] team, a French [[privateer (motorsport)|privateer]], and a French [[motorcycle|rider]]. Racers were also blamed for starting a [[wildfire]] that caused a panic on a train running between Dakar and [[Bamako]], where three more people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Robert Carlton |date=1988-02-01 |title=Disastrous days in the desert |journal=[[Sports Illustrated]] |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=20(4)}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2003 French driver Daniel Nebot both rolled and crashed his Toyota heavily at high speed killing his co-driver Bruno Cauvy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-70955196.html Article: French Driver Dies in Paris-Dakar Rally – AP Online | HighBeam Research – FREE trial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&amp;n=1715 Motorsport Memorial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;In 2005, Spanish motorcyclist [[José Manuel Pérez]] died in a Spanish hospital on Monday, January 10 after crashing the week before on the 7th stage. Italian motorcyclist [[Fabrizio Meoni]], a two-time winner of the event, became the second Dakar Rally rider to die in two days, following Pérez on January 11 on stage 11. Meoni was the 11th motorcyclist and the 45th competitor overall to die in the history of the race. On January 13, a five-year-old [[Senegal]]ese girl was crushed beneath the wheels of a [[service lorry]] after wandering onto a main road, bringing the total deaths to five.In 2006, 41-year-old Australian [[KTM]] motorcyclist [[Andy Caldecott]], in his third time in the Dakar, died January 9 as a result of neck injuries received in a crash approximately 250&amp;nbsp;km (155&amp;nbsp;mi) into stage 9, between [[Nouakchott]] and [[Kiffa]], only a few kilometers from the location where Meoni had his fatal wreck the year before. He won the third stage of the 2006 event between [[Nador]] and [[Er Rachidia]] only a few days before his death. The death occurred despite efforts by the event organisers to improve competitor safety, including speed limits, mandatory rest at fuel stops, and reduced fuel capacity requirements for the bike classes. On January 13, a 10-year-old boy died while crossing the course after being hit by a car driven by Latvian [[Māris Saukāns]], while on January 14 a 12-year-old boy was killed after being hit by a support lorry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Second boy dies during Dakar |url=http://www.motoring.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3065770 |publisher=motoring.co.za |date=2006-01-14 |accessdate=2008-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2007, 29-year-old South African motor racer [[Elmer Symons]] died of injuries sustained in a crash during the fourth stage of the Rally.

The cause of death was initially believed to be a heart attack,&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-6359377,00.html |title=Dakar hit by second death on eve of finish |publisher=The Guardian |date=2007-01-20 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it was later suggested that Aubijoux died of internal injuries sustained in a crash earlier that day while competing in the 14th stage of the race.{{Wikinews|2008 Dakar Rally cancelled over terrorist threat}}The [[2008 Dakar Rally]] was cancelled due to security concerns after [[al-Qaeda]]'s murder of four French tourists on Christmas Eve in December 2007 in Mauritania (a country in which the rally spends eight days), accusations against the rally calling it &quot;neo-colonialist,&quot; and accusations against Mauritania calling it a supporter of &quot;crusaders, apostates and infidels&quot;. The French-based [[Amaury Sport Organisation]] in charge of the {{convert|6000|km|mi|-2|sing=on}} rally said in a statement that they had been advised by the French government to cancel the race which had been due to begin on January 5, 2008 from Lisbon. They said direct threats had also been made against the event by al-Qaeda related organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN648110.html | work=Reuters | title=News | Africa – Reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=673196 The Times – Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Omar Osama bin Laden]], son of [[Osama bin Laden]],  attracted  news coverage in 2008 by promoting himself as an &quot;ambassador of peace&quot; and proposing a {{convert|3000|mi|km|sing=on}} horse race across North Africa as a replacement to the Dakar Rally, with sponsors' money going to support child victims of war, saying ''&quot;I heard the rally was stopped because of al-Qaida.

He had been missing for three days and his body lay on a remote part of the second stage between Santa Rosa de la Pampa and Puerto Madryn.In 2010, on 4 January, a woman watching the Dakar Rally was killed when a vehicle taking part in the race veered off the course and hit her during the opening stage on Saturday. The 4x4 was driven by Mirco Schultis and partner Ulrich Leardi.==Criticism=={{Criticism section|date=November 2010}}When the race was held in Africa, it was subject to criticism from several sources, generally focusing on the race's impact on the inhabitants of the African countries through which it passed.Some African residents along the race's course in previous years have said they saw limited benefits from the race; that race participants spent little money on the goods and services local residents can offer. The racers produced substantial amounts of dust along the course, and were blamed for hitting and killing livestock, in addition to occasionally injuring or killing people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Doggett |first=Gina |date=2004-01-18 |title=Paris-Dakar rally brings 'little but dust', Senegalese villagers say |publisher=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;After the 1988 race, when three Africans were killed in collisions with vehicles involved in the race, [[Panafrican News Agency|PANA]], a Dakar-based [[news agency]], wrote that the deaths were &quot;insignificant for the [race's] organisers&quot;. The [[Vatican City]] newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' called the race a &quot;vulgar display of power and wealth in places where men continue to die from hunger and thirst.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooke |first=James |date=1988-03-13 |title=Dangerous Paris-Dakar race is endangered |publisher=The New York Times |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2002 protest at the race's start in [[Arras, France|Arras]], France, a [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]] of France statement described the race as &quot;colonialism that needs to be eradicated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Paterne |first=Elodie |date=2001-12-28 |title=Protests overshadow start of Paris-Dakar race |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;The rally was criticised before 2000 for crossing through the disputed territory of [[Western Sahara]], without the approval of the [[Polisario Front]], which considers itself the representative of the [[Sahrawi people]]. After the race officials began asking for formal permission from the Polisario from 2000 onwards, this ceased to be an issue.The environmental impact of the race has been another area of criticism. This criticism of the race is notably the topic of the song &quot;''500 connards sur la ligne de départ''&quot; (&quot;500 Assholes at the Starting Line&quot;), on the album ''[[Marchand de cailloux]]'' by [[France|French]] singer [[Renaud]]. According to recent figures provided by the Dakar Rally, the carbon emissions of the two week race are approximately equivalent to a [[Formula One]] race.&lt;ref&gt;Environment and Power Economy Agency, under &quot;Carbon Footprint&quot;, demonstrating that the Dakar Rally emits 22,000 metric tons of carbon, compared with the 2007 Rugby World Cup, which emitted 570,000 metric tons (see methodology) http://www.dakar.com/2008/DAK/presentation/us/r2_4-impact_environnemental.html&lt;/ref&gt;Olivier Louchard at Climate Action Network France calculated that including all aspects related to the event, the 2010 race will produce 22 000 T of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |date=2010-10-12 |title=Global |publisher=[[ARTE TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Gallery===&lt;gallery&gt;File:Fidel German Dakar2007.jpg|[[Nissan]] Patrol at the Lisbon-Dakar 2007.File:Rallye_Lac_Rose_097.jpg|Russian [[Kamaz|Kamaz 4911]], Ten time Dakar winner.File:Rodrigo Amaral Dakar2007.jpg|[[Bowler Wildcat]] on the Dakar Rally in 2007.File:Dakar 2006 Floirac Kastan Cornuaille.jpg|Three motorcyclists on [[KTM]] machines.File:Dakar 2006 Schlesser.jpg|[[Jean-Louis Schlesser]]'s [[Ford]] powered [[dune buggy]].File:Dakar 2006 Hummer Gordon.jpg|[[Hummer H3]] buggy, driven by [[Robby Gordon]] in 2006.File:Ssangyong Kyron Dakar 2009 Isidre Esteve02.jpg|[[SsangYong Kyron]] driven by [[Isidre Esteve Pujol]] in 2009.File:Xraid_X3CC_Dakar2011.jpg|Stéphane Peterhansel in a X-raid BMW X3 CC at Dakar 2011&lt;/gallery&gt;==See also==* [[Budapest-Bamako]] – Desert Rally* [[Rallye des Pharaons]]==References=={{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}==External links=={{commons category|Paris Dakar Rally}}*[http://www.dakar.com dakar.com] (multilingual){{Dakar Rally}}[[Category:Dakar Rally| ]][[Category:Motorsport in Africa]][[af:Dakar-tydren]][[ar:رالي دكار]][[bs:Dakar Reli]][[bg:Рали Дакар]][[ca:Ral·li Dakar]][[cv:Ралли Дакар]][[cs:Rallye Dakar]][[cy:Rali Dakar]][[da:Dakar Rally]][[de:Rallye Dakar]][[el:Ράλι Ντακάρ]][[es:Rally Dakar]][[eo:Ralio Parizo-Dakaro]][[eu:Dakar Rallya]][[fa:رالی داکار]][[fr:Rallye Dakar]][[gl:Rally Dakar]][[hr:Reli Dakar]][[id:Reli Dakar]][[it:Parigi-Dakar]][[he:ראלי דקר]][[lv:Dakaras rallijs]][[lt:Dakaro ralis]][[li:Paries-Dakar]][[hu:Dakar-rali]][[nl:Dakar-rally]][[ja:ダカール・ラリー]][[no:Rally Dakar]][[pl:Rajd Dakar]][[pt:Rali Dakar]][[ro:Raliul Dakar]][[ru:Ралли Дакар]][[sk:Rely Dakar]][[sl:Reli Dakar]][[sr:Дакар рели]][[fi:Dakar-ralli]][[sv:Dakarrallyt]][[th:ดาการ์แรลลี]][[tr:Dakar Rallisi]][[uk:Ралі Дакар]][[wa:Raliye eviè Dakar]][[zh:达喀尔拉力赛]]</text></revision></page>
